He is also a naturopath and chiropractor.\nBut I suspect his first love is homeopathy.\nWhen I sent out a request on the Internet for feedback on this man, I got some glowing praise and the hint of a true\nexplorer, a man pushing the envelope. But part of the glue keeping the envelope together is his attention to thescientific method. The first chapter Explaining Homeopathy  is a thorough reporting of the studies that prove\nhomeopathy works and that its benefits are not due to placebo effect. For those of us who already know thathomeopathy works because we have had first hand experience, this may not be necessary; however, in order forthe practice of homeopathy to spread and be accepted by the medical profession, these studies are essential.\nI was also very impressed with Dr. Callinan's ability to synthesize the recent advances in biophysics, hormesis and\npharmacology in a successful attempt to explain how and why homeopathy works. Back in 1888 Arndt developedthe Arndt-Schulz Law, which stated that for every substance, small doses stimulate, moderate doses inhibit, largedoses kill. The world followed the path of moderate drug doses, which work on the inhibitory curve of the scaleproducing the suppressant effect of drugs. Homeopathic medicine begins at the lower doses which are stimulatoryand moves to even smaller doses. This is in an effort to stimulate the body's natural balancing mechanisms.\nHormesis is the Arndt-Schulz Law revived in modern toxicology. Since 1960q data has demonstrated the existence\nof two effects of poisonous substances on living organisms. At high doses they inhibited metabolism and ultimatelycaused death, but at low doses they exerted a stimulating\n \n< previous page page_xiii next page >", "number": 13, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "xiii", "foreword", "paul", "callinan", "australian", "great", "affinity", "homeopathy", "also", "naturopath", "chiropractor", "suspect", "first", "love", "homeopathy", "sent", "request", "internet", "feedback", "man", "got", "glowing", "praise", "hint", "true", "explorer", "man", "pushing", "envelope", "part", "glue", "keeping", "envelope", "together", "attention", "thescientific", "method", "first", "chapter", "explaining", "homeopathy", "thorough", "reporting", "studies", "prove", "homeopathy", "works", "benefits", "due", "placebo", "effect", "us", "already", "know", "thathomeopathy", "works", "first", "hand", "experience", "may", "necessary", "however", "order", "forthe", "practice", "homeopathy", "spread", "accepted", "medical", "profession", "studies", "essential", "also", "impressed", "callinan", "ability", "synthesize", "recent", "advances", "biophysics", "hormesis", "pharmacology", "successful", "attempt", "explain", "homeopathy", "works", "back", "arndt", "developedthe", "law", "stated", "every", "substance", "small", "doses", "stimulate", "moderate", "doses", "inhibit", "largedoses", "kill", "world", "followed", "path", "moderate", "drug", "doses", "work", "inhibitory", "curve", "scaleproducing", "suppressant", "effect", "drugs", "homeopathic", "medicine", "begins", "lower", "doses", "stimulatoryand", "moves", "even", "smaller", "doses", "effort", "stimulate", "body", "natural", "balancing", "mechanisms", "hormesis", "law", "revived", "modern", "toxicology", "since", "data", "demonstrated", "existence", "two", "effects", "poisonous", "substances", "living", "organisms", "high", "doses", "inhibited", "metabolism", "ultimatelycaused", "death", "low", "doses", "exerted", "stimulating", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_xiv next page >\nPage xiv\neffect. This is an astonishing finding and parallels the action of homeopathy. At large doses a drug can cause the\nsame symptoms that can be treated with small doses.\nDr. Callinan also explains the mechanism by which the water molecules are imprinted with the vibratory rate of the\nsubstance being potentized. He explains that this work is in the realm of biophysics, that it is a relatively newdiscipline and that most medical doctors are not familiar with it and therefore ignore or deny its findings.Biophysics can apply tests to water which determine that structural changes do occur in water when a substance isdiluted and succussed. When water alone, with no substance added, is succussed, there are no structural changes. Itis this change in the water molecule that imparts information to the body to cause a desired effect.\nThus far I have only talked about one chapter of a very large homeopathic encyclopedia. The rest of the book is\njust as impressive. Callinan has managed to include, not only a homeopathic materia medica , but also a complete\nreview of the Bach Flower Remedies, the 12 tissue salts, a first-aid kit and comprehensive treatments for 130conditions.\nThe Bach Flower Remedies were one of the first modalities that I learned, and I found them invaluable in practice.\nDr. Callinan has managed to transmit the essence of each remedy in a very brief description that can be easilymemorized and be recalled to treat specific conditions as they arise.\nThe 12 tissue salts are low-potency homeopathics of mineral salts that seem to work because they treat a mineral\ndeficiency in the patient but they also have a particular homeopathic picture that Dr. Callinan describes veryclearly.\nThe materia medica  listing of remedies is also described in a most concise and ''user-friendly'' way. The keynotes\nof the remedy and general appearance of the patient who needs the remedy are set apart from the symptom picture,\nwhich makes it much easier to understand what to prescribe. In most old texts all three aspects are often jumbledtogether and it is hard to get the feel of a remedy. It is wise to read through this section to familiarize yourself withthe remedies that seem to suit you, your disposition and tendencies, so that when the need arises you are able to gostraight to a short list of possibilities. It is this type of knowledge that centers you and allows you to focus onhelping yourself or your family. There is no better resource or means of taking responsibility for your health thanhomeopathy\n \n< previous page page_xiv next page >", "number": 14, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "xiv", "effect", "astonishing", "finding", "parallels", "action", "homeopathy", "large", "doses", "drug", "cause", "symptoms", "treated", "small", "doses", "callinan", "also", "explains", "mechanism", "water", "molecules", "imprinted", "vibratory", "rate", "substance", "potentized", "explains", "work", "realm", "biophysics", "relatively", "newdiscipline", "medical", "doctors", "familiar", "therefore", "ignore", "deny", "apply", "tests", "water", "determine", "structural", "changes", "occur", "water", "substance", "isdiluted", "succussed", "water", "alone", "substance", "added", "succussed", "structural", "changes", "itis", "change", "water", "molecule", "imparts", "information", "body", "cause", "desired", "effect", "thus", "far", "talked", "one", "chapter", "large", "homeopathic", "encyclopedia", "rest", "book", "impressive", "callinan", "managed", "include", "homeopathic", "materia", "medica", "also", "complete", "review", "bach", "flower", "remedies", "tissue", "salts", "kit", "comprehensive", "treatments", "bach", "flower", "remedies", "one", "first", "modalities", "learned", "found", "invaluable", "practice", "callinan", "managed", "transmit", "essence", "remedy", "brief", "description", "easilymemorized", "recalled", "treat", "specific", "conditions", "arise", "tissue", "salts", "homeopathics", "mineral", "salts", "seem", "work", "treat", "mineral", "deficiency", "patient", "also", "particular", "homeopathic", "picture", "callinan", "describes", "veryclearly", "materia", "medica", "listing", "remedies", "also", "described", "concise", "way", "keynotes", "remedy", "general", "appearance", "patient", "needs", "remedy", "set", "apart", "symptom", "picture", "makes", "much", "easier", "understand", "prescribe", "old", "texts", "three", "aspects", "often", "jumbledtogether", "hard", "get", "feel", "remedy", "wise", "read", "section", "familiarize", "withthe", "remedies", "seem", "suit", "disposition", "tendencies", "need", "arises", "able", "gostraight", "short", "list", "possibilities", "type", "knowledge", "centers", "allows", "focus", "onhelping", "family", "better", "resource", "means", "taking", "responsibility", "health", "thanhomeopathy", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_xv next page >\nPage xv\nThe therapy section itself comprises the bulk of the book. There are chapters on first aid, common ailments, infants,\nchildren, mothers, women and men. For each condition there are from two to 20 remedies prescribed and often alittle naturopathic advice thrown in for good measure.\nThe chapter for mothers is comprehensive and includes such difficult problems as herpes in pregnancy and\nmiscarriage. The miscarriage section covers threatened and true miscarriage and delineates the different remediesfor both. There is a detailed section on labor which should be extremely helpful to any doctor, midwife or mother.There are no natural allopathic treatments for easing labor. What a wonderful way to bring a new life into theworld with the use of natural, nontoxic homeopathic remedies.\nDr. Callinan has done a great service in writing this exceptional book. Family Homeopathy  will replace several\nbooks that I previously used for reference.Family Homeopathy  is a wonderful book for the novice lay homeopath and a great reference book for the\nknowledgeable. I recommend it highly.\nCAROLYN DEAN, B.SC., M.D.\n \n< previous page page_xv next page >", "number": 15, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "xv", "therapy", "section", "comprises", "bulk", "book", "chapters", "first", "aid", "common", "ailments", "infants", "children", "mothers", "women", "men", "condition", "two", "remedies", "prescribed", "often", "alittle", "naturopathic", "advice", "thrown", "good", "measure", "chapter", "mothers", "comprehensive", "includes", "difficult", "problems", "herpes", "pregnancy", "miscarriage", "miscarriage", "section", "covers", "threatened", "true", "miscarriage", "delineates", "different", "remediesfor", "detailed", "section", "labor", "extremely", "helpful", "doctor", "midwife", "natural", "allopathic", "treatments", "easing", "labor", "wonderful", "way", "bring", "new", "life", "theworld", "use", "natural", "nontoxic", "homeopathic", "remedies", "callinan", "done", "great", "service", "writing", "exceptional", "book", "family", "homeopathy", "replace", "several", "books", "previously", "used", "homeopathy", "wonderful", "book", "novice", "lay", "homeopath", "great", "reference", "book", "knowledgeable", "recommend", "highly", "carolyn", "dean", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_xvii next page >\nPage xvii\nINTRODUCTION\nHomeopathy: Its Place In Medicine\nHomeopaths, like all natural therapists, have always agreed on the most fundamental point in the treatment of\ndisease: that disease is caused by mistakes in the habits of living. Correct the mistakes of living, the thinking goes,and disease will take care of itself. Only if the body has trouble in regaining its equilibrium should medicine begiven.\nTo date, this approach to medicine has served us well. It has taken the responsiblity for personal health from the\ndoctor and given it back to the individual. The message has been clear: live well, and last longer; look after yourlife, and its quality will improve. Our vitality, a precious gift, should be nurtured; our life should be in our ownhands.\nVitality is the health factor that orthodox medicine has forgotten. Known more correctly as allopathy, orthodox\nmedicine is just one of the ten or so mainstream schools of medical thought existing throughout the world:massage, herbalism, nature cure, nutrition, naturopathy, ayurveda, unani, acupuncture, osteopathy, chiropractic andhomeopathy make up the list of the main alternative medicines. These systems are traditionally developed, withtheir roots deep in their countries' cultures.

Hippocrates, in turn, had already been influenced by unani, the medicine of the ancient Persians andEgyptians, and by ayurveda from India. In this way it can be seen that many medical systems have commonbeginnings.\nMost of these medicines, with the notable exception of allopathy, have as their basic tenet that it is the vital energy\nof the patient that must be treated, not just the physical symptoms. These medical systems are currently used forthe treatment of well over half of the world's population, and many have the support of the World HealthOrganization, particularly in Third World countries. This support is fostering research, and an emergence oftraditional medicines is occurring worldwide.\nThe great developments that allopathic medicine lists as proof of its effectiveness are mostly confined to the\ndevelopment of sophisticated tests, the treatment of life-threatening disorders, such as infection and traumaticinjury, and to one of its greatest triumphs, essential surgery. In these areas it is without peer. Much of thisdevelopment began in World War II, when the need for these was high; the development of specialized surgicalprocedures, antibiotics and pain killers were particularly notable achievements. It was believed these successeswould be repeated with breakthroughs in the treatment of a broader range of illnesses.\nBut the routine use of allopathic medicines in treatment is not showing the success hoped for; the cost of drug\nresearch is going up, and reports of side effects are increasing. The public is becoming more aware of the toxiceffects of many drugs. It is no news to anyone acquainted with the allopathic system that it functions principally totreat existing illness and to care for the chronically ill: to pull people out of the river and resuscitate them, ratherthan to prevent them falling in. There is a neglect of prevention, and the incidence of most preventable diseases(such as cancer, asthma, heart disease, osteoporosis and hypertension) remains unacceptably high. There is also alack of urgency in the treatment of chronic disease compared with acute disease; with the exception of injuries,Western medicine's most prevalent, serious, and costly health problems nearly all concern chronic disease.\nHomeopathy is regarded by its practitioners as being well suited to the treatment of most common disorders,\nincluding chronic disease, where allopathy is less appropriate. Homeopathic medicines offer many advantages, thegreatest being that they are safe, easy to use and cheap.

They can be made from any substance in\nthe animal, vegetable or mineral kingdoms. All told, probably about 2000 homeopathic mother tinctures have beenprepared from different substances, and more are always being tested somewhere in the world. Mother tinctures areused as raw material, and in homeopathy are seldom used undiluted, except occasionally on wounds. Theproportion of alcohol, which is used as a preservative, can be as high as 80 per cent in some preparations.\nLotions are dilutions of the mother tincture, usually by about 1:10 tincture:water, but up to about 1:50. They can be\napplied externally as often as desired to control suppuration and promote healing. When applied direct to the skinthey may also have a drying effect. When added to gauze, as a dressing for a wound, the gauze should not beallowed to dry out. Lotion can be re-applied to the outside of a dressing before it dries, so the dressing may needto be changed less often.\nPotencies are higher dilutions of the mother tincture than are lotions, and are given internally. The dilutions used\nby homeopaths are very high by allopathic standards, but homeopaths maintain that this very dilution produces amedicinal action not yet properly researched.\nNormally, I part of mother tincture is added to 9 parts water, and shaken rhythmically. This is known as a Ix\n(decimal) dilution, or I part in 10. One part of this is then taken and added to another 9 parts water, and againshaken, to give a 2x dilution, or I part in 100. Similarly, a 3x dilution is I part in 1000, and a 6x is I part permillion. These dilutions, also known as potencies, can be repeated a lot of times; the higher the dilution, the higherthe potency number.\nDilutions are also made on a centesimal scale, or I part in 100, yielding 1c, 2c, and so on. A 6c potency, commonly\nrecommended in this book, is a dilution of 1 in 10 followed by 12 zeroes.

Yet the medicine still works, and many notablecures have been obtained at these dilutions.\nThe shaking procedure is known as succussion, and is regarded by homeopaths as an essential part of the dilution\nstage. Together, the dilution and succussion process is known as potentization, and can be repeated manythousands of times in the preparation of the medicines.\nAlthough medicines for domestic use are not normally used above 6c and 12c, much higher potencies can be\nobtained from homeopaths for more specialized treatment. A number of 30c potencies, recommended forprotection against infectious diseases such as influenza and measles, for example, are included in this book, andcan be obtained from any homeopathic practitioner or homeopathic dispensary. Higher potencies are best obtainedfrom a homeopath after consultation.\nMention should also be made of the tissue salts, which are homeopathic preparations of the twelve main mineral\nsalts found in the body. These are also called cell salts and biochemic salts, and are widely available ashomeopathic pilules in a 6x potency through health food shops and homeopathic pharmacies. Their use now hasextended for over a century since their development by Dr. William Schuessler in Europe, and they are a valuableaddition to any domestic homeopathic kit.\nSafety\nThe safety of a wide variety of homeopathic medicines has been checked by government authorities. You would\nneed to drink about five liters of a homeopathic medicine above 3x before you would begin to poison yourself.Anyone trying this would be unconscious from the alcohol, used as the preservative, before they approached atoxic dose. Since domestic doses are normally about 6 drops, a further safety factor is built in.\nAs a result, homeopathic medicines are particularly useful for home treatments. They are of good use in a wide\nrange of disordersfor infants, children, women, men and the elderly. Therefore it is in the service of humanity thatthis book is presented.\n \n< previous page page_xx next page >", "number": 19, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "xx", "used", "homeopaths", "dilution", "followed", "zeroes", "close", "point", "none", "original", "substance", "remaining", "normal", "dose", "drops", "yet", "medicine", "still", "works", "many", "notablecures", "obtained", "dilutions", "shaking", "procedure", "known", "succussion", "regarded", "homeopaths", "essential", "part", "dilution", "stage", "together", "dilution", "succussion", "process", "known", "potentization", "repeated", "manythousands", "times", "preparation", "medicines", "although", "medicines", "domestic", "use", "normally", "used", "much", "higher", "potencies", "obtained", "homeopaths", "specialized", "treatment", "number", "potencies", "recommended", "forprotection", "infectious", "diseases", "influenza", "measles", "example", "included", "book", "andcan", "obtained", "homeopathic", "practitioner", "homeopathic", "dispensary", "higher", "potencies", "best", "obtainedfrom", "homeopath", "consultation", "mention", "also", "made", "tissue", "salts", "homeopathic", "preparations", "twelve", "main", "mineral", "salts", "found", "body", "also", "called", "cell", "salts", "biochemic", "salts", "widely", "available", "ashomeopathic", "pilules", "potency", "health", "food", "shops", "homeopathic", "pharmacies", "use", "hasextended", "century", "since", "development", "william", "schuessler", "europe", "valuableaddition", "domestic", "homeopathic", "kit", "safety", "safety", "wide", "variety", "homeopathic", "medicines", "checked", "government", "authorities", "would", "need", "drink", "five", "liters", "homeopathic", "medicine", "would", "begin", "poison", "trying", "would", "unconscious", "alcohol", "used", "preservative", "approached", "atoxic", "dose", "since", "domestic", "doses", "normally", "drops", "safety", "factor", "built", "result", "homeopathic", "medicines", "particularly", "useful", "home", "treatments", "good", "use", "wide", "range", "disordersfor", "infants", "children", "women", "men", "elderly", "therefore", "service", "humanity", "thatthis", "book", "presented", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_1 next page >\nPage 1\nPART ONE\nHOMEOPATHY: HOW DOES IT WORK?\n \n< previous page page_1 next page >", "number": 20, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "part", "one", "homeopathy", "work", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_3 next page >\nPage 3\n1\nExplaining Homeopathy\nThe rising profile of homeopathy has produced something of a dilemma in the world of medicine: does it work or\ndoesn't it? The decision bites deep: if homeopathic medicine is nothing but fraud, quackery and placebo, as manyof its opponents would maintain, then a large number of competently trained homeopaths and doctors, togetherwith countless thousands of dedicated lay practitioners, have been led up the medical garden path. Their millions ofpatients, including many heads of state and prominent members of several of Europe's royal families, have fallenvictim to the most successful medical hoax ever perpetrated. On the other hand, if homeopathic medicine iseffective, then for the first time in more than a hundred years the Western world is on the verge of accepting anentirely new system of medicine. Unlike modern pharmaceutical drugs, homeopathic medicines are non-toxic andeasily manufactured; they are also very cheap.\nDuring its 170 years of existence, homeopathy has been the center of continual and often bitter medical\ncontroversy. It has been particularly opposed by orthodox medicine, otherwise known as allopathy. But recently,both research and patient support has grown at a rapid pace. Yet rather than being hailed as a possible new medicalbreakthrough to give better health for all, it has been ridiculed, ignored and systematically suppressed.\nClearly, something is wrong.

Obviously then, the objection goes, any medicinal effect is nothing but placebo,and the homeopaths are both frauds and charlatans.\nYet the origins of homeopathic medicine are both honorable and orthodox. It was developed in Germany by the\nresearch of Dr. Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1834), who as well as being an experienced orthodox physician wasalso a competent chemist, a good mineralogist and botanist, and an able translator of eight different languages. Hisresearch stemmed from a dissatisfaction with the standard medical practices of his time: routine bleedings, heroicpurgings with cathartics, and administration of large doses of crude drugs. While translating into German theMateria Medica  by William Cullen, a Scottish professor of medicine, he was struck by a hitherto unexplored\nmedical observation, first mentioned by Hippocrates. Cullen had proposed that the notable success of cinchona (anextract of quinine bark) in the treatment of swamp fever was due to its value as a stomach tonic. Hahnemanndisagreed, and in his research on the question decided to take a course of the cinchona extract himself. To hissurprise, he developed a set of symptoms remarkably similar to those of the swamp fever it was used to treat. Allthe symptoms disappeared when he stopped taking it. Further administration to himself and his family alwaysproduced the same symptoms, varying only in degree.\nThis was a strange phenomenon, uncited in the medical literature of the day: a remedy that was effective in a\nparticular disease would produce a similar set of symptoms in a healthy person, when given in sufficient doses. Insearching for precedents for this effect, he established that the first mention made of it was in the writings ofHippocrates (460-377 BC), regarded by the orthodoxy as the father of modern medicine. Hippocrates had said thatlikes can be cured by likes: that vomiting may be stopped by being made to vomit, and any illness caused by onemeans can be treated successfully by a similar means.\nThe Law of Similars\nFrom this Hahnemann produced the first axiom of homeopathy, Sireilia Similibus Curentur Let Likes be Cured by\nLikes, otherwise known as the Law of Similarsand so began his life's work. By 1821 he had produced two major\nworks: The Organon of Rational Medicine , embodying the principles\n \n< previous page page_4 next page >", "number": 22, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "cines", "diluted", "extremes", "shown", "physically", "chemically", "mathematically", "nothing", "final", "dose", "water", "obviously", "objection", "goes", "medicinal", "effect", "nothing", "placebo", "homeopaths", "frauds", "charlatans", "yet", "origins", "homeopathic", "medicine", "honorable", "orthodox", "developed", "germany", "research", "samuel", "hahnemann", "well", "experienced", "orthodox", "physician", "wasalso", "competent", "chemist", "good", "mineralogist", "botanist", "able", "translator", "eight", "different", "languages", "hisresearch", "stemmed", "dissatisfaction", "standard", "medical", "practices", "time", "routine", "bleedings", "heroicpurgings", "cathartics", "administration", "large", "doses", "crude", "drugs", "translating", "german", "themateria", "medica", "william", "cullen", "scottish", "professor", "medicine", "struck", "hitherto", "unexplored", "medical", "observation", "first", "mentioned", "hippocrates", "cullen", "proposed", "notable", "success", "cinchona", "anextract", "quinine", "bark", "treatment", "swamp", "fever", "due", "value", "stomach", "tonic", "hahnemanndisagreed", "research", "question", "decided", "take", "course", "cinchona", "extract", "hissurprise", "developed", "set", "symptoms", "remarkably", "similar", "swamp", "fever", "used", "treat", "allthe", "symptoms", "disappeared", "stopped", "taking", "administration", "family", "alwaysproduced", "symptoms", "varying", "degree", "strange", "phenomenon", "uncited", "medical", "literature", "day", "remedy", "effective", "particular", "disease", "would", "produce", "similar", "set", "symptoms", "healthy", "person", "given", "sufficient", "doses", "insearching", "precedents", "effect", "established", "first", "mention", "made", "writings", "ofhippocrates", "bc", "regarded", "orthodoxy", "father", "modern", "medicine", "hippocrates", "said", "thatlikes", "cured", "likes", "vomiting", "may", "stopped", "made", "vomit", "illness", "caused", "onemeans", "treated", "successfully", "similar", "means", "law", "similars", "hahnemann", "produced", "first", "axiom", "homeopathy", "sireilia", "similibus", "curentur", "let", "likes", "cured", "likes", "otherwise", "known", "law", "similarsand", "began", "life", "work", "produced", "two", "major", "works", "organon", "rational", "medicine", "embodying", "principles", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_5 next page >\nPage 5\nof the homeopathic approach to medicine, and his Materia Medica Pura, covering the effects of 64 medicines.\nHis approach to medicine represented a dramatic move away from the established method. Allopaths establish the\nexistence of a particular disease, clarify its symptoms, and then test the effectiveness of various medicines on it, bythe use of opposites. An illness accompanied by fever and diarrhea, for example, would call for the combined useof medicines that are anti-febrile and others that normally constipate, and so, in a crude way, a total balance wouldbe found by using a number of appropriate medicines together.\nHomeopaths tried the opposite approach: first test a substance for medicinal use, they said, by giving it to healthy\nvolunteers, and carefully noting the symptoms it produces. This is known as a \"proving.\" Once the symptompicture has been fully developed over a number of human trials, then the remedy can be assessed for usefulnessagainst diseases with a similar set of symptoms. A substance that produces a bizarre set of symptoms such asbright red orifices and blue-green discharges, for example, will have little use in homeopathic clinical practicebecause symptoms of this type are rarely met. However a substance that produces a runny nose, watery, red eyesand repeated sneezing would be of great value in the treatment of hay fever. The common onion produces justthose symptoms (as countless cooks can guarantee) and by use of the above trial system the onion has nowachieved an established place in homeopathic therapeutics.\nIn essence, allopathic medicine embodies the law of opposites, homeopathic medicine the law of similars.\nPotentizatton\nAt first the homeopathic approach to medicine seems contradictory. Surely experience tells us that exposing hay\nfever sufferers to large doses of onion would just add insult to injury, and make them worse rather than better. Thehomeopaths would agree, but with two provisos.\nFirst, the symptoms must match closely before onion will have a therapeutic effect; this is embodied in their Law\nof the Single Remedy, which states that the most effective result will come from the most similar remedy, given insingle doses. Then after the initial aggravation of symptoms dies down, the hay fever will be noticeably better.\n \n< previous page page_5 next page >", "number": 23, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "homeopathic", "approach", "medicine", "materia", "medica", "pura", "covering", "effects", "medicines", "approach", "medicine", "represented", "dramatic", "move", "away", "established", "method", "allopaths", "establish", "existence", "particular", "disease", "clarify", "symptoms", "test", "effectiveness", "various", "medicines", "bythe", "use", "opposites", "illness", "accompanied", "fever", "diarrhea", "example", "would", "call", "combined", "useof", "medicines", "others", "normally", "constipate", "crude", "way", "total", "balance", "wouldbe", "found", "using", "number", "appropriate", "medicines", "together", "homeopaths", "tried", "opposite", "approach", "first", "test", "substance", "medicinal", "use", "said", "giving", "healthy", "volunteers", "carefully", "noting", "symptoms", "produces", "known", "proving", "symptompicture", "fully", "developed", "number", "human", "trials", "remedy", "assessed", "usefulnessagainst", "diseases", "similar", "set", "symptoms", "substance", "produces", "bizarre", "set", "symptoms", "asbright", "red", "orifices", "discharges", "example", "little", "use", "homeopathic", "clinical", "practicebecause", "symptoms", "type", "rarely", "met", "however", "substance", "produces", "runny", "nose", "watery", "red", "eyesand", "repeated", "sneezing", "would", "great", "value", "treatment", "hay", "fever", "common", "onion", "produces", "justthose", "symptoms", "countless", "cooks", "guarantee", "use", "trial", "system", "onion", "nowachieved", "established", "place", "homeopathic", "therapeutics", "essence", "allopathic", "medicine", "embodies", "law", "opposites", "homeopathic", "medicine", "law", "similars", "potentizatton", "first", "homeopathic", "approach", "medicine", "seems", "contradictory", "surely", "experience", "tells", "us", "exposing", "hay", "fever", "sufferers", "large", "doses", "onion", "would", "add", "insult", "injury", "make", "worse", "rather", "better", "thehomeopaths", "would", "agree", "two", "provisos", "first", "symptoms", "must", "match", "closely", "onion", "therapeutic", "effect", "embodied", "law", "single", "remedy", "states", "effective", "result", "come", "similar", "remedy", "given", "insingle", "doses", "initial", "aggravation", "symptoms", "dies", "hay", "fever", "noticeably", "better", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_6 next page >\nPage 6\nSecond, if the initial doses of onion are sufficiently diluted, there will be very little aggravation at all before\nimprovement sets in. In fact, the homeopaths see dilution to infinitesimal degrees as a necessary part of thepreparation of their medicines. It is embodied in the other important axiom for treatment: the Law of the MinimalDose. This states that the most effective dose for a disorder is the minimum amount necessary to produce aresponse. Give one dose only of the diluted substance, the homeopaths say, and then wait for a favorable reaction.Having produced the desired improvement, give a second dose only when improvement stops.\nIt is this dilution of homeopathic medicines that has been the greatest obstacle to their more universal acceptance.\nThe process is known as potentization, and involves a sequence of progressive dilution and a rhythmic shaking,termed succussion. In the normal case, I part of the source substance is added to 9 parts of water and shakenrhythmically. This is known as a Ix (decimal) dilution, or I part in 10 (also written as 100-1). One part of this isthen taken and added to another 9 parts of water, and again succussed, to give a 2x dilution, or I part in 100 (10-2).Similarly, a 3x dilution is I part in 1000 (10-3). These dilutions, also known as potencies, can be repeated a largenumber of times.\nDilutions are also made on a centesimal scale, or I part in 100, yielding 1c, 2c and so on. It needs only a little\nmental arithmetic to appreciate that a dilution procedure of this type (either decimal or centesimal) rapidlydisperses the original substance. Table I gives a summary of the potencies, and their corresponding dilutions.\nThe Avogadro LimitIn practice, a convenient classification of the dilutions is usually used.Low potencies: 1x-30x, or 1c-15c.Medium potencies: 30c-200c.High potencies: above 200c.\n \n< previous page page_6 next page >", "number": 24, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "second", "initial", "doses", "onion", "sufficiently", "diluted", "little", "aggravation", "improvement", "sets", "fact", "homeopaths", "see", "dilution", "infinitesimal", "degrees", "necessary", "part", "thepreparation", "medicines", "embodied", "important", "axiom", "treatment", "law", "minimaldose", "states", "effective", "dose", "disorder", "minimum", "amount", "necessary", "produce", "aresponse", "give", "one", "dose", "diluted", "substance", "homeopaths", "say", "wait", "favorable", "produced", "desired", "improvement", "give", "second", "dose", "improvement", "stops", "dilution", "homeopathic", "medicines", "greatest", "obstacle", "universal", "acceptance", "process", "known", "potentization", "involves", "sequence", "progressive", "dilution", "rhythmic", "shaking", "termed", "succussion", "normal", "case", "part", "source", "substance", "added", "parts", "water", "shakenrhythmically", "known", "ix", "decimal", "dilution", "part", "also", "written", "one", "part", "isthen", "taken", "added", "another", "parts", "water", "succussed", "give", "dilution", "part", "dilution", "part", "dilutions", "also", "known", "potencies", "repeated", "largenumber", "times", "dilutions", "also", "made", "centesimal", "scale", "part", "yielding", "needs", "little", "mental", "arithmetic", "appreciate", "dilution", "procedure", "type", "either", "decimal", "centesimal", "rapidlydisperses", "original", "substance", "table", "gives", "summary", "potencies", "corresponding", "dilutions", "avogadro", "limitin", "practice", "convenient", "classification", "dilutions", "usually", "potencies", "potencies", "potencies", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_7 next page >\nPage 7\nTable 1\nComparison of homeopathic potencies\nDECIMAL SCALE CENTESIMAL SCALE CONCENTRATION\n1x 1c 10-1\n2x 2c 10-2\n3x 3c 10-3\n4x 6c 10-4\n6x 12c 10-6\n12x 15c 10-12\n24x 30c 10-24\n30x 200c 10-24\n1,000c (1M) 10-30\n10,000c (10M) 10-60\n100,000c (CM) 10-400\n1,000,000c (MM) 10-200010-20,00010-200,00010-2,000,000\nYou will notice that the low potencies have been diluted least, and may still contain significant amounts of the\nsource drug.

Yet potencies in themedium to high dilution range are the normal working area of homeopathy, and many striking cures have beenclaimed using them. The first and obvious response by allopaths is to claim that the action in successful cases ispurely placebo, and the medicine is useful only to the suggestible and the gullible. Not so, maintain thehomeopaths, who claim cures on infants, animals, unconscious patients, those with infectious diseases, and thosewith deep-seated, chronic disorders. In addition, the clinical trials are impressive. So the medical plot thickens.\nClinical Trials\nThe early homeopaths were all trained allopaths and, once having been convinced of the effectiveness of\nhomeopathic medicines, felt no need to prove anything to anybody. After all, they had the training to use whatevermedicine they considered appropriate for their patients. It was also expedient for them to make as little noise aspossible about their use of a medical system that was already regarded as suspect within their own ranks. In anycase, most of their research time was spent on provings, in order to expand the number of known and usefulmedicines, and very little on clinical trials.\nAs a result, it took an event of considerable magnitude to bring homeopathy out into the open, and the European\ncholera epidemic of 1832, two years before Hahnemann's death, was the occasion. By all accounts the homeopathshad a far higher recovery rate than the allopaths; it is said that in Paris the price of the homeopathic medicine forcholera increased a hundredfold. In Russia (where the epidemic originated), the report from the Russian Consul-General showed that of the 1270 cases treated homeopathically, 1162 recovered and only 108 died, giving amortality rate of less than 10 per cent. By contrast, the mortality rate from allopathic treatment was 60 to 70 percent. 1\nFollowing the homeopathic success in this epidemic medical interest in homeopathy increased at a rapid rate, and\nby the time of the next European cholera epidemic in 1854 the London Homoeopathic Hospital was alreadyestablished. Its facilities were turned over entirely to the treatment of cholera victims, and the results wereimpressive.

Similar successful\nfigures were reluctantly reported by a number of other countries. 2 In Britain detailed returns had to be made by allhospitals and practitioners as to treatment and results in cholera, and the totals published by the British MedicalCouncil in their Blue Book of Statistics . However, the figures from the Homoeopathic Hospital were deliberately\nomitted, and were only produced after considerable protest. The official reason for the omission was that inclusionof the homeopathic figures 2 ''would give an unjustifiable sanction to an empirical practice, alike opposed to the\nmaintenance of truth and the progress of science.''\nThis prejudiced and bigoted reaction to the success of homeopathic medicine is typical of the problem that has\nplagued the advance of science for many centuries. Orthodox medicine, in particular, is well known for its poortrack record in meeting innovative change and research breakthroughs with the proper degree of scientificdetachment and quiet encouragement. Even within their own ranks some of the greatest of innovators, such asLister, Jenner and Harvey, suffered ridicule and professional ostracism over discoveries that later becamemainstays of medical practice. In reaction to homeopathic successes, the modem orthodox call has been for moreclinical trials. Give us controlled trials, many allopaths have said, and if successful, we will accept the medicine.\nSince that time, a number of clinical trials have been run, but many of them with poor controls. Some of the better-\nrun trials are summarized here briefly. Those looking for a more complete list could do no better than the excellentreview of Scofield. 3\nMustard gas\nThe best controlled of the early clinical trials was conducted jointly in London and Glasgow during the Second\nWorld War, to find a method of prevention and treatment of mustard-gas burns. Mustard gas in the 6c potency,given as a preventative, reduced the incidence of deep and medium burns significantly. The remedies Rhus tox andKali bich also gave statistically significant results in treatment. 4\nRheumatoid arthritis\nMore recent trials were conducted in 1978 at the Glasgow Homoeopathic Hospital, now emerging as a stronghold\nof homeopathic research.

They showed that the patients who received homeopathic remedies respondedstatistically better than those who received salicylates; moreover, 42 per cent of the homeopathic group were ableto discontinue all other treatment during the year. 5\nObjections to the method of trial led to a more rigidly designed trial in 1980, where patients were given either a\nhomeopathic medicine or a placebo, but were allowed to continue with their orthodox anti-inflammatory drugs.The homeopathic group showed significant improvement as judged by a number of tests, as compared to thepatients who received placebo. It was noted that homeopathy was a safer and no less effective alternative topresent-day second-line drugs in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. 6\nHomeopathic Remedies Not PlaceboThe Crack Widens\nOne of the most recent clinical trials, and certainly the most tightly controlled to date, was conducted in 1986 at the\nGlasgow Homoeopathic Hospital by David Taylor Reilly, an allopath by training. The claim that homeopathicmedicines are placebo was tested in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. In statistical terms, this isabout as tough a trial as can be set up.\nThe effects of a homeopathic preparation of mixed grass pollens (30c potency, no molecules of the original pollen\nremaining) were compared with those of a placebo in a total of 144 patients with active hay fever. Thehomeopathically treated patients showed a statistically significant reduction in symptoms as assessed by bothpatient and physician. No evidence emerged to support the idea that placebo action explains the clinical response tohomeopathic remedies. 7\nThe publishing of Reilly's results in the Lancet , arguably the most prestigious medical journal in the world,\nindicates the current depth of penetration of homeopathic medicine into the allopathic world. The controversy itproduced indicated the degree of crystallization of the collective allopathic brain. Here at last was proof positive inthe much upheld double-blind trial, yet the collective reaction was less than positive.

Reactions to drugs are caused\nby molecules of drug substances interacting with various body components, the thinking goes, and if there are nodrug molecules in a medicine then there is no reaction aside from placebo effects. The experiment was simplytesting one placebo against another. The fact that statistical significance was obtained for one of the \"placebos\" wasapparently deemed of no consequence, and indicates that the issue may not be a scientific issue at all, but more aneconomic and emotional one.\nPharmacological Support\nLogically, one of the first areas to investigate for support (or the lack of it) in homeopathy is the area of\npharmacology, or drug action. And, contrary to expectations, some surprising support is appearing.\nAsk a pharmacologist about the biological effect of very low concentrations of common substances on living\norganisms and the answer will be that there is typically very little or zero response. Ask for some theoreticalbackup, and in short order you will find yourself confronted by one of the pharmacological tools of the trade, theDose-Response curve. In brief, the curve illustrates one of the rules of thumb in drug use: that an increased dose ofdrug will give an increased effect, while a lowered dose of a drug will give a reduced effect, and a very low dosewill give no effect at all.\nA glance at the curve in Figure 2 will show that the pharmacologically recommended dose of a drug lies in the area\nof the ED 50, the dose that produces 50 per cent of the total or maximum effect. The homeopathic area of interest,\non the other hand, lies at the very start of the curve, in the area of the so-called threshold dose.\nThe area of the threshold dose is usually avoided in standard pharmacological drug testing, for two reasons. The\nfirst is that the threshold dose lies some distance from the area of the ED 50, so investigating this area for drug\nreaction is basically a waste of time. But the other reason is far more interesting. The threshold dose is an areawhere paradoxical and contradictory results are obtained, not easily explained in conventional terms. Again, theeasy answer is to simply avoid it in experimentation. But the bottom line is that for many years the pharmacologistshave known of the strange results obtained in the threshold\n \n< previous page page_11 next page >", "number": 30, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "reliance", "pharmacology", "allopathic", "way", "thinking", "showed", "dominance", "reactions", "drugs", "caused", "molecules", "drug", "substances", "interacting", "various", "body", "components", "thinking", "goes", "nodrug", "molecules", "medicine", "reaction", "aside", "placebo", "effects", "experiment", "simplytesting", "one", "placebo", "another", "fact", "statistical", "significance", "obtained", "one", "placebos", "wasapparently", "deemed", "consequence", "indicates", "issue", "may", "scientific", "issue", "aneconomic", "emotional", "one", "pharmacological", "support", "logically", "one", "first", "areas", "investigate", "support", "lack", "homeopathy", "area", "pharmacology", "drug", "action", "contrary", "expectations", "surprising", "support", "appearing", "ask", "pharmacologist", "biological", "effect", "low", "concentrations", "common", "substances", "living", "organisms", "answer", "typically", "little", "zero", "response", "ask", "theoreticalbackup", "short", "order", "find", "confronted", "one", "pharmacological", "tools", "trade", "curve", "brief", "curve", "illustrates", "one", "rules", "thumb", "drug", "use", "increased", "dose", "ofdrug", "give", "increased", "effect", "lowered", "dose", "drug", "give", "reduced", "effect", "low", "dosewill", "give", "effect", "glance", "curve", "figure", "show", "pharmacologically", "recommended", "dose", "drug", "lies", "area", "ed", "dose", "produces", "per", "cent", "total", "maximum", "effect", "homeopathic", "area", "interest", "hand", "lies", "start", "curve", "area", "threshold", "dose", "area", "threshold", "dose", "usually", "avoided", "standard", "pharmacological", "drug", "testing", "two", "reasons", "first", "threshold", "dose", "lies", "distance", "area", "ed", "investigating", "area", "drug", "reaction", "basically", "waste", "time", "reason", "far", "interesting", "threshold", "dose", "areawhere", "paradoxical", "contradictory", "results", "obtained", "easily", "explained", "conventional", "terms", "theeasy", "answer", "simply", "avoid", "experimentation", "bottom", "line", "many", "years", "pharmacologistshave", "known", "strange", "results", "obtained", "threshold", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_12 next page >\nPage 12\nFigure 2\nA typical pharmacological Dose-Response curve\ndose area, but have simply chosen to ignore them. In doing so, they have unwittingly withdrawn orthodox support\nfor an entirely different field of medicine;\nIt is interesting that one of the very earliest laws of pharmacology, known as the Arndt-Schulz Law, had already\nexpressed the homeopathic effect. Formulated by Arndt in 1888, and restated by Hueppe a few years later, the lawset the groundwork for what should have been a side-by-side development of allopathic and homeopathic medicinein the following century. It states: For every substance, small doses stimulate, moderate doses inhibit, large doseskill.\nAllopathic medicine, with its emphasis on moderate drug doses, works in the inhibitory part of the scale. The resultis seen in the typically inhibitory medicines produced: antihistamines, antibiotics, antacids, cough suppressants andso on, laying the basis for the so-called \"suppressant\" effect of drugs.\nHomeopathic medicine, on the other hand, begins at the stimulatory end of the curve, and moves to the left, into\nthe smaller and smaller dose range. Its emphasis is on the stimulation of the body's natural balancing mechanisms,as seen in its philosophy of the natural regeneration of the body through rebuilding of vitality, a concept also inclose agreement with naturopathic thought.\n \n< previous page page_12 next page >", "number": 31, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "figure", "typical", "pharmacological", "curve", "dose", "area", "simply", "chosen", "ignore", "unwittingly", "withdrawn", "orthodox", "support", "entirely", "different", "field", "medicine", "interesting", "one", "earliest", "laws", "pharmacology", "known", "law", "already", "expressed", "homeopathic", "effect", "formulated", "arndt", "restated", "hueppe", "years", "later", "lawset", "groundwork", "development", "allopathic", "homeopathic", "medicinein", "following", "century", "states", "every", "substance", "small", "doses", "stimulate", "moderate", "doses", "inhibit", "large", "doseskill", "allopathic", "medicine", "emphasis", "moderate", "drug", "doses", "works", "inhibitory", "part", "scale", "resultis", "seen", "typically", "inhibitory", "medicines", "produced", "antihistamines", "antibiotics", "antacids", "cough", "suppressants", "andso", "laying", "basis", "suppressant", "effect", "drugs", "homeopathic", "medicine", "hand", "begins", "stimulatory", "end", "curve", "moves", "left", "smaller", "smaller", "dose", "range", "emphasis", "stimulation", "body", "natural", "balancing", "mechanisms", "seen", "philosophy", "natural", "regeneration", "body", "rebuilding", "vitality", "concept", "also", "inclose", "agreement", "naturopathic", "thought", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_13 next page >\nPage 13\nFigure 3\nGraphical representation of the Arndt-Schulz Law\nThe pioneering work of Dr William Boyd in the early 1940s 8 bound the worlds of homeopathy and Arndt-Schulz\ntogether with a series of tightly controlled experiments, and set the stage for work much later on as to howhomeopathic medicine may work. Boyd worked with the enzyme malt diastase, which was already known to beinhibited by crude doses of the salt mercuric chloride, and measured its speed in the hydrolysis of starch. He alsoused a number of homeopathically prepared dilutions of mercuric chloride, including a batch at 61x, where therewas no likelihood of any of the original salt remainingit was pure water. He additionally worked with distilledwater as a control. He showed that crude doses of mercuric chloride inhibited diastase activity, as was already wellknown, and that distilled water had no effect. But he also showed, with statistically significant results, thatmercuric chloride 61x  accelerated diastase activity.\nNow this experiment had a number of ramifications, besides supporting the Arndt-Schulz Law.

If, on theother hand, there was a contamination of mercuric chloride somehow in the test doses, then the activity of thediastase enzyme should have decreased. Instead it did neither, but increased.

It died out of the textbooks as allopathic interest moved further into the inhibitorypart of the Arndt-Schulz curve, and as the pharmacological Dose-Response curve avoided the area of the thresholddose. It appeared that, for all its promising origins, theoretical support for homeopathy had died a natural death.\nRecently, however, further support for homeopathic medicine has come from a most unlikely direction: the field of\ntoxicology, or the action of poisons. Beginning in 1960, data began to accumulate that poisonous substances werehaving two effects on living organisms. 9 At high doses they inhibited metabolism and ultimately caused death, aswas well known. But at low doses they exerted a stimulating effect, a response totally unexpected and notexplainable by current medical science. Recently the trickle turned to a torrent, as toxicologists have turned toexamine the new phenomenon of hormesis, the name given to the stimulatory effect of low levels of usuallypoisonous substances. 101112 13 14 15 The Arndt-Schulz Law has not died: it has simply resurfaced with a new\nname.\nThe research results are incomplete, but the trend is inescapable.

It demonstrates that all substances (including pesticides and carcinogens) that show an inhibitory effect at\nhigh concentrations, have a stimulatory effect at low concentrations.\nFigure 5\nTypical concentration-response curves \ndeveloped in hormesis research 16\nIn Figure 5 the alpha ( a) curve is the most expected pattern, and is assumed to describe the actions of drugs in\nhumans as the concentration moves from low concentrations to progressively more inhibitory ones. This curve is atentative one, and is assigned to those drugs that have not yet been fully tested for a stimulatory response.\nThe beta ( b) curve was the most frequently observed pattern, and accounted for the human reactions to the bulk of\nthe drugs tested. It shows a typical curve as predicted by the Arndt-Schulz Law, but (understandably) was not\ntested in toxic and lethal dose ranges.\nThe two other curves, the gamma ( g) and delta ( d) forms, were recorded where data was available for biological\nresponse at lower dose ranges. However, data points for these ranges are generally less available, so the validity of\nthese curves is unknown until further data is available.\nHomeopathic research has consistently produced results showing the basic curve structure of hormesis and the\nArndt-Schulz Law. But the research goes further: as the drug substance is progressively diluted, the biologicalreaction alternates between stimulation and inhibition, as given by the hormesis gamma and delta curves. Thisperiodic behavior is called rhythmicity  by homeopaths, and represents one of the several great unexplained\nphenomena in homeopathic action. But one factor has been established: as the dilutions become extreme and theconcentration of the source drug approaches zero, the biological reaction will also fade out unless the dilutedsolution is succussed in accord with traditional homeopathic practice.\n \n< previous page page_15 next page >", "number": 34, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "support", "demonstrates", "substances", "including", "pesticides", "carcinogens", "show", "inhibitory", "effect", "high", "concentrations", "stimulatory", "effect", "low", "concentrations", "figure", "typical", "curves", "developed", "hormesis", "research", "figure", "alpha", "curve", "expected", "pattern", "assumed", "describe", "actions", "drugs", "humans", "concentration", "moves", "low", "concentrations", "progressively", "inhibitory", "ones", "curve", "atentative", "one", "assigned", "drugs", "yet", "fully", "tested", "stimulatory", "response", "beta", "b", "curve", "frequently", "observed", "pattern", "accounted", "human", "reactions", "bulk", "drugs", "tested", "shows", "typical", "curve", "predicted", "law", "understandably", "tested", "toxic", "lethal", "dose", "ranges", "two", "curves", "gamma", "g", "delta", "forms", "recorded", "data", "available", "biological", "response", "lower", "dose", "ranges", "however", "data", "points", "ranges", "generally", "less", "available", "validity", "curves", "unknown", "data", "available", "homeopathic", "research", "consistently", "produced", "results", "showing", "basic", "curve", "structure", "hormesis", "law", "research", "goes", "drug", "substance", "progressively", "diluted", "biologicalreaction", "alternates", "stimulation", "inhibition", "given", "hormesis", "gamma", "delta", "curves", "thisperiodic", "behavior", "called", "rhythmicity", "homeopaths", "represents", "one", "several", "great", "unexplained", "phenomena", "homeopathic", "action", "one", "factor", "established", "dilutions", "become", "extreme", "theconcentration", "source", "drug", "approaches", "zero", "biological", "reaction", "also", "fade", "unless", "dilutedsolution", "succussed", "accord", "traditional", "homeopathic", "practice", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_16 next page >\nPage 16\nFigure 6\nA typical rhythmicity curve of the homeopathic \nremedy Prunus spinosa (experimental data)\nHow Does Homeopathy Work?\nCentral to the issue of medical acceptance of homeopathy is the clarification of its mechanism of action. In\nparticular, is there a model that adequately explains its clinical effectiveness and the successes of the trials?\nIn the development of a workable model, the research thinking has gone something like this: given that\nhomeopathic medicine is effective even when it can be shown that there is no likelihood of any molecules beingleft in a particular dose (due to dilution), then the effect of the dose must lie with the water molecules themselves,since that is all that is left. Water itself can be assumed to have no effect in this case, since the dose is small, andthe effect would always be the same. The answer must lie within the water molecules, and the only real possibilityis in the type of energy that the molecule has stored.\nEnergy storage within molecules in biological systems lies within the realm of biophysics rather than biochemistry.\nBiophysics is a new field, having become established only within the last twenty years or so.

Small wonder, therefore, that the established medical world knows little of itsexistence, or the promise it holds in explaining the action of the medicines of energy, such as homeopathy,acupuncture, psychic and spirit healing and radionics.\nEnergy StorageMolecules such as water can store energy in four different waysas motion, spin, vibration and electronic excitation.\nSome storage modes can store more energy than others, and we will start at the lowest, least energetic mode, whichis kinetic energy, or energy of motion. A molecule stores kinetic energy by virtue of its speed. It is this storage ingases and liquids that causes pressure (such as air pressure) by the continual collision of the molecules withsurfaces like our skin, and also causes the bulk of chemical reactions to occur. At room temperature, the energy thatthese molecules contain is low, compared with other states. It is unlikely to be associated with homeopathicmedicine's effects, since the energy is constantly altered by collision, and so any energy stored is quickly degraded.\nSpin and Microwave CookingSpin energy is found in gases and liquids, but not in solids, where the stronger attractions between molecules\nprevents rotation. It is also not found in water until it reaches about 108\u00b0F (42\u00b0C), a factor of considerableimportance to living organisms, composed as they are of up to 90 per cent water, with humans being about 40 percent. Heating water to about 108\u00b0F causes sufficient disruption of the molecular attraction between molecules toallow spin to occur, and that's precisely the temperature at which humans start to die. Life processes in generalseem to keep a safe distance from the temperature band of 108-113\u00b0F.\nSpin energy in molecules corresponds to microwave radiation, which is one reason why this radiation is lethal. It is\nalso an indication of the potential power of energy storage in this modestrong enough to cook food. But it isunlikely to be the source of action of homeopathic medicine, since at room temperature the spin storage state inwater has not become active.\n \n< previous page page_17 next page >", "number": 36, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "yet", "included", "medical", "curricula", "universities", "great", "extent", "beginning", "make", "mark", "biological", "sciences", "small", "wonder", "therefore", "established", "medical", "world", "knows", "little", "itsexistence", "promise", "holds", "explaining", "action", "medicines", "energy", "homeopathy", "acupuncture", "psychic", "spirit", "healing", "radionics", "energy", "storagemolecules", "water", "store", "energy", "four", "different", "waysas", "motion", "spin", "vibration", "electronic", "excitation", "storage", "modes", "store", "energy", "others", "start", "lowest", "least", "energetic", "mode", "whichis", "kinetic", "energy", "energy", "motion", "molecule", "stores", "kinetic", "energy", "virtue", "speed", "storage", "ingases", "liquids", "causes", "pressure", "air", "pressure", "continual", "collision", "molecules", "withsurfaces", "like", "skin", "also", "causes", "bulk", "chemical", "reactions", "occur", "room", "temperature", "energy", "thatthese", "molecules", "contain", "low", "compared", "states", "unlikely", "associated", "homeopathicmedicine", "effects", "since", "energy", "constantly", "altered", "collision", "energy", "stored", "quickly", "degraded", "spin", "microwave", "cookingspin", "energy", "found", "gases", "liquids", "solids", "stronger", "attractions", "molecules", "prevents", "rotation", "also", "found", "water", "reaches", "factor", "considerableimportance", "living", "organisms", "composed", "per", "cent", "water", "humans", "percent", "heating", "water", "causes", "sufficient", "disruption", "molecular", "attraction", "molecules", "toallow", "spin", "occur", "precisely", "temperature", "humans", "start", "die", "life", "processes", "generalseem", "keep", "safe", "distance", "temperature", "band", "spin", "energy", "molecules", "corresponds", "microwave", "radiation", "one", "reason", "radiation", "lethal", "also", "indication", "potential", "power", "energy", "storage", "modestrong", "enough", "cook", "food", "isunlikely", "source", "action", "homeopathic", "medicine", "since", "room", "temperature", "spin", "storage", "state", "inwater", "become", "active", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_18 next page >\nPage 18\nFigure 7\nEnergy storage in molecules\nSTORAGE STATE TYPE OF ENERGY STORED\nMotionKinetic energy\nTranslational energy\nSpin Microwave radiation\nVibrationInfrared radiationHeat\nElectronic Excitation Light\nElectronic Excitation\nAt the top end of the scale is electronic excitation, which is the stuff powering lasers, of great strength and\nintensity.

Vibratoryenergy can be found in molecules throughout all three states of mattersolid, liquid and gas. It is responsible forphenomena such as the expansion of metals when heated, and the transfer of heat by conduction. Vibratory motionof a molecule increases when the molecule absorbs energy, and this vibratory energy can be re-radiated at a latertime, usually in the infrared part of the spectrum, where heat is also found.\nIt is in the storage of vibratory energy in water molecules during the succussion process that homeopathic medicine\nplaces many of its hopes for a scientific explanation of its action. It is proposed that during the collision process,vibratory energy is exchanged between the source drug and the water, and that the water is left with a vibratoryimprint of the drug. Further succussion makes the imprint deeper, which explains why the medicines are regardedas acting more strongly as the dilution increases. Furthermore it is not just energy that is being stored, it isproposed, but information, differing from one remedy to another depending on the source substance used, withevery substance leaving a different vibratory signature in the water molecule. In this way homeopathic medicine isseen as carrying information into the body when it is taken in dose form, perhaps as biological instructions.\nIf water molecules were dissociated from each other (moving freely in all directions) at room temperature, any\nvibratory energy stored would quickly degrade. But at 77\u00b0 (25\u00b0C) about 70 per cent of water molecules areincorporated into a stable, hexagonal, lattice structure, capable of storing a considerable amount of vibratory energybefore it breaks up. However, storage of vibratory energy causes structural changes, because any molecule thatabsorbs energy will always change its shape. So a convenient way of telling if this particular model was possiblewas to examine homeopathic water for structural changes.\nA number of workers over the years have shown that both high and low potency homeopathic medicines show\nstructural changes in the water they contain. It was additionally shown that in order for the structural changes tooccur, two things must happen.

Second, you must succuss\nthe remedy as it is diluted stepwise, in the rhythmic shaking manner used by the homeopaths for many years. Onlywhen these two processes are included will structural changes show.\nBenvenisteChampion or Charlatan?In one of the stranger episodes in the recorded history of scientific publishing, the prestigious British research\njournal Nature  recently published experimental results which the editors say they consider utterly impossible. The\npaper, ''Human Basophil Degranulation Triggered by Very Dilute Antiserum Against IgE'' 17, and the conclusionsit proposes, has stirred up substantial controversy in the medical community.\nThe main players in the experiment were an eminent French medical researcher, Professor Benveniste, a special\ntype of white blood cell known as a basophil, and an antibody, IgE. When basophils are normally exposed to thisantibody, their chemistry and internal structure change, in a way that is easily checked by staining techniques. Butwhat Benveniste and his colleagues found was that the changes occurred even when the antibody was used up tothe 120x potency, a dilution at which it is mathematically impossible for even one molecule of the antibody toremain.\nThe results also showed the familiar rhythmic changes in basophil reactions as the potencies increased, a factor still\nunexplained even by homeopaths. The deputy editor of Nature  remarked that two centuries of observation and\nrational thinking about biology will have to be abandoned if the results stand, because they cannot be explained byexisting physical laws.\nThe 13-member international research team headed by Professor Benveniste conducted their experiments after\nbeing challenged by two eminent French homeopaths to disprove homeopathy. To settle the question once and forall, they conducted a sensitive, tightly controlled experiment at the University of South Paris, where ProfessorBenveniste is a research director. \"That was how it all started,\" he said. \"They challenged us to prove them wrong,and we couldn't.\" Instead, the experiment showed strong support for homeopathy.\nThe furor surrounding this experiment has produced some unique reactions within the scientific community, and\nhighlights an important question: how should the scientific establishment deal with findings that challenge the veryroots of established thought?

Over a period of a week they\ncriticized shortcomings in experimental design, studied the laboratory records and interrogated the researchers.Finally, they failed to replicate the results in a double-blind trial, and declared the experiments \"a delusion.\"Professor Benveniste, not unexpectedly, considered the investigation a witch hunt and an outrage. \"I welcome anyexplanation for our findings on homeopathy,\" he said, \"but not this kind of rubbish.''\nNew Findingsa Recent Survey of Clinical TrialsAs a useful summary of all published trials, a recent paper in the British Medical Journal  reviewed the evidence of\n107 homeopathic trials from 96 published reports. 19 Most of the trials were considered to be of poor quality;\nhowever, there were exceptions. The best trials were those by Grecho and by Reilly. Reilly's trial was to testwhether homeopathic medicines were placebo, and came out in favor of the medicine being therapeutically active.The Grecho trial was specialized, and some would argue out of the realm of homeopathy: it looked at recovery ofbowel movements after surgery and gave a negative result.\nOverall the results of all trials showed a positive trend, regardless of the quality of the trial or the prescribing\nsystem used. Of the 105 trials with interpretable results, 81 trials indicated positive results using homeopathicremedies, while in 24 no positive effects were found. A more interesting, and perhaps more useful, result can bedrawn from looking at the most recent trials, which were also the most tightly controlled. Of these trials, nineshowed a positive result in favour of homeopathy being therapeutically valid, and two gave negative findings.\nThe review concluded that the evidence from clinical trials was positive but not sufficient to draw definitive\nconclusions, and recommended more well-conducted trials. Nevertheless the homeopaths of the world can now bereassured that what we always knew to be true is at last starting to appear in the research: that homeopathy works.\nHomeopathy Around the World\nHomeopathy is achieving increasing support and acceptance worldwide.

Figures worldwide are\ndifficult to find, but the following items of information will help to set a global picture.\nBelgiumAll natural therapy practitioners are registered with a central medical council. One person in every four visits a\nnatural therapist. Homeopathy is the most popular treatment. 20\nDenmarkThere are about 2000 registered natural therapists, including homeopaths. About one in 10 of the population go to\nthem.21\nFranceIn France 20,000 pharmacies sell homeopathic remedies, and many faculties of pharmacy award postgraduate\ndiplomas in homeopathy. One quarter of all French doctors have prescribed homeopathic medicines. Acupunctureand homeopathy are taught in some university medical faculties. One in six patients is given homeopathictreatments. 2223\nThe Netherlands\nThe integration of orthodox and alternative medicines is encouraged by the government. Training in natural\ntherapies is restricted to university-trained doctors. 24\nIndia\nThe government directly supports and funds many of the 120 homeopathic medical colleges and research\nestablishments in India. There are now 125,000 trained and registered degree-level homeopaths practicingthroughout the country. There are over 2000 dispensaries and over 100 homeopathic hospitals, all government-funded. There is also a government-funded National Institute of Homeopathy in Calcutta. The president of Indiahas an honorary homeopathic physician. 25\nSouth Africa\nEducation for naturopathy, homeopathy and herbalism is currently available at government-funded tertiary\ninstitutions. 26\n \n< previous page page_23 next page >", "number": 42, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "homeopathy", "education", "systems", "number", "countries", "figures", "worldwide", "difficult", "find", "following", "items", "information", "help", "set", "global", "picture", "belgiumall", "natural", "therapy", "practitioners", "registered", "central", "medical", "council", "one", "person", "every", "four", "visits", "natural", "therapist", "homeopathy", "popular", "treatment", "denmarkthere", "registered", "natural", "therapists", "including", "homeopaths", "one", "population", "go", "francein", "france", "pharmacies", "sell", "homeopathic", "remedies", "many", "faculties", "pharmacy", "award", "postgraduate", "diplomas", "homeopathy", "one", "quarter", "french", "doctors", "prescribed", "homeopathic", "medicines", "acupunctureand", "homeopathy", "taught", "university", "medical", "faculties", "one", "six", "patients", "given", "homeopathictreatments", "netherlands", "integration", "orthodox", "alternative", "medicines", "encouraged", "government", "training", "natural", "therapies", "restricted", "doctors", "india", "government", "directly", "supports", "funds", "many", "homeopathic", "medical", "colleges", "research", "establishments", "india", "trained", "registered", "homeopaths", "practicingthroughout", "country", "dispensaries", "homeopathic", "hospitals", "also", "national", "institute", "homeopathy", "calcutta", "president", "indiahas", "honorary", "homeopathic", "physician", "south", "africa", "education", "naturopathy", "homeopathy", "herbalism", "currently", "available", "tertiary", "institutions", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_24 next page >\nPage 24\nUsa\nIt appears that in the United States there is now an enormous swing to alternative medicine. A recent report showed\nthat more than one in three Americans had used alternative medicines at least once in 1990. Furthermore, the studyfound that patients made more than 425 million visits to alternative practitioners that year, in contrast to 388million visits to family doctors and other primary care physicians. Among the 16 systems examined werechiropratic, vitamin therapy, massage, acupuncture, homeopathy, herbal medicine and spiritual healing. Affluentand well-educated 25-49-year-oldsthe nation's most influential consumer groupwere found to be most likely to tryalternative health care. 27\nAlthough much of the modern development of homeopathy occurred in America because of the efforts of pioneers\nthere such as James Tyler Kent and Constantine Hering, homeopathy in America has been largely suppressed.Now for the first time in many decades a conventional American medical school is running a course inhomeopathic medicine. The first training program is now being offered at Arizona State University MedicalSchool, and includes continuing medical education credits for practicing allopaths. Other courses, includingweekend seminars, are pending approval. The two-year course will be followed by one year of clinical training.\nUnited KingdomAbout one person in eight goes to a natural therapist. British law puts no restriction on natural therapists, who may\ntake referrals from doctors. Homeopathy is practiced under the National Health Service, and has a wide level ofacceptance. All homeopathic medicines prescribed by a doctor are available under the National Health Service;many doctors practice homeopathy and many pharmacists stock homeopathic medicines. The Queen and othermembers of the royal family have an appointed honorary homeopathic physician. 2829 30\nA recent article published in the British medical journal Doctor  looked at a survey of GPs' attitudes toward\nhomeopathy.

This act was put into place to ensure that medicines sold in Australia were ata world standard of quality, safety and efficacy. Although most homeopathic medicines are exempt from theAustralian Register of Therapeutic Goods set up by the Health Department, some specific remedies have alreadybeen included on the register. They must comply with standards of quality and safety, and must also comply withthe same legislation as all other medicines concerning standards of manufacture and labeling.\nQualified homeopaths now have government recognition as health-care professionals under recent legislation.\nWhile official registration as Medicare providers will be a long time coming (if it comes at all), it is safe to say thathomeopathy is now established in Australia.\nNotes\n1 Bradford's Logic of Figures (1900), from  Tyler, 'Homeopathic Drug Pictures', Health Science , 1978.\n2 Tyler, 'Homeopathic Drug Pictures', Health Science , 1978.\n3 Scofield, 'Homeopathy and Its Potential Role in Agriculture.

They should not be stored in the refrigerator, nor close to microwave ovens or computers.They should be taken under the tongue in a clean mouth, preferably about half an hour before meals.

Symptoms such as being worse in a draught, or always better in humid weather or in the open air, candecisively indicate the correct choice of remedy.\nThe remedies listed in this book have been chosen for a number of reasons: they are well suited to the disorders\nfound in the average home, they are safe and easy to use, and they have clear-cut symptoms. To begin with, youmay care to rely on the descriptions of the symptoms given for each disorder in this book.

But you will soon become aware that these medicines work best\nby treating the patient as an individual and the body as a whole. At about this time you would find Part Two, \"AMateria Medica of Common Remedies,\" useful, as each remedy there is summarized, showing its main pattern ofsymptoms.\nIt is the understanding of the pattern of symptoms in a remedywhat the homeopaths call a symptom picturethat is\nthe key to prescribing. A remedy that closely matches in its symptom picture the symptoms of the patient is knownin homeopathy as the similimum, the most similar remedy, and is the one to prescribe. In these cases, its action isdramatic and gratifying, and quickly repays the effort of prescribing correctly.\nDose\nHow often you give a medicine will depend on the potency you use, the type of illness, and the age of the patient.\nAs a general rule, low potencies of 6x, or 3c, to 12c are used for acute complaints, such as colds, attacks ofvomiting, wounds, and so on. Medium potencies of 30c are used in more established conditions such as recurrentmigraines or entrenched period pain. Higher potencies, of 200c and above, are used in deeper constitutionaltreatment, and are best left to experienced prescribers.\nMany of the potencies mentioned in this book are for 6x and 6c; these are good, fast-acting potencies, well suited\nto the majority of domestic disorders. They are available in a variety of dose forms, including liquids, pilules,tablets and oral sprays.\nA normal dose of any liquid is about 6 drops, usually taken under the tongue, but the remedy can be rubbed into\nthe chest in cases where opening the mouth is difficult.

Deeper damage, especially involving\nunderlying muscle, nerves and blood vessels, is a laceration; these wounds are typically torn and jagged, and areoften badly pulped.\nThe first action needed is always to stop any bleeding. Elevation of the wound (holding it higher than the rest of\nthe body) will always help. Clean the wound as far as possible: holding it under cold running water willsubstantially remove debris although embedded particles may need to be removed with forceps or tweezers. Largewounds may need pressure to bring the edges together, and usually require allopathic treatment (stitching).Wounds containing badly pulped tissue, or showing uncontrollable suppuration, should also receive allopathictreatment.\nTreatmentThe choice of lotion or ointment to apply depends on the nature of the wound. Homeopathic lotions are known as\ntinctures, and may be put directly on the wound, or on a pierce of gauze (the gauze should be kept moist).

Although the\nwound may appear insignificant, deeper structures may be injured, or infection may be implanted. Damage toimportant organs, or large blood vessels, requires allopathic treatment.\nWatch for tetanus. The typical case of tetanus occurs from a sharp but dirty object that punctures the skin and\npenetrates a short distance, with the wound closing over when the sharp object is withdrawn. The incubation periodfor tetanus (the time taken for any implanted tetanus infection to produce enough toxin to affect the spinal cord)may be anywhere from two to thirty days; the average is about ten. The longer the period of incubation, the milderthe disease. After any untreated deep puncture wounds, tetanus should always be suspected if the patient complainsof cramping, especially in the face or bowel. The following remedies can be used on puncture wounds whileallopathic advice is being immediately sought.\nTreatmentGeneral treatment externally.Ledum tincture,  1 in 10 dilution .\nGeneral treatment internally.Ledum 6c,  every 3-4 hours for a few days .\nIf the wound is painful, and there are shooting pains.Hypericum 6c,  every 3-4 hours, each time pain returns .\nSprains and StrainsStrains occur when the ligaments around a joint have been stretched, and sprains when they have been torn. The\nsurrounding membranes of the joint may also be involved, resulting in fluid building up, which stretches the jointcapsule and limits joint movement. In all cases, pain, swelling and discoloration occur. If the joint is badlydisplaced or wobbling, or impossible to straighten or bend, allopathic treatment is necessary, but can be followedwith advantage by homoeopathic treatment.\n \n< previous page page_42 next page >", "number": 64, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "puncture", "wounds", "type", "wound", "usually", "caused", "nail", "thorn", "splinter", "similarly", "object", "although", "wound", "may", "appear", "insignificant", "deeper", "structures", "may", "injured", "infection", "may", "implanted", "damage", "toimportant", "organs", "large", "blood", "vessels", "requires", "allopathic", "treatment", "watch", "tetanus", "typical", "case", "tetanus", "occurs", "sharp", "dirty", "object", "punctures", "skin", "penetrates", "short", "distance", "wound", "closing", "sharp", "object", "withdrawn", "incubation", "periodfor", "tetanus", "time", "taken", "implanted", "tetanus", "infection", "produce", "enough", "toxin", "affect", "spinal", "cord", "may", "anywhere", "two", "thirty", "days", "average", "ten", "longer", "period", "incubation", "milderthe", "disease", "untreated", "deep", "puncture", "wounds", "tetanus", "always", "suspected", "patient", "complainsof", "cramping", "especially", "face", "bowel", "following", "remedies", "used", "puncture", "wounds", "whileallopathic", "advice", "immediately", "sought", "treatmentgeneral", "treatment", "tincture", "dilution", "general", "treatment", "every", "hours", "days", "wound", "painful", "shooting", "every", "hours", "time", "pain", "returns", "sprains", "strainsstrains", "occur", "ligaments", "around", "joint", "stretched", "sprains", "torn", "surrounding", "membranes", "joint", "may", "also", "involved", "resulting", "fluid", "building", "stretches", "jointcapsule", "limits", "joint", "movement", "cases", "pain", "swelling", "discoloration", "occur", "joint", "badlydisplaced", "wobbling", "impossible", "straighten", "bend", "allopathic", "treatment", "necessary", "followedwith", "advantage", "homoeopathic", "treatment", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_43 next page >\nPage 43\nMuscular problems, such as stiffness after unaccustomed exercise, have essentially the same treatment, so are\ncovered here as well.\nTreatmentAs a general treatment.Apply  ice packs  immediately, externally .\nFor muscle strain after unaccustomed exercise, involving rupture, swelling and bruised pain.Arnica tincture,  diluted 1 in 10, applied locally as a firm compress;\nArnica 6c,  internally, every 3-4 hours .\nFor a sprain or strain of joint, with painful ligament, tendon or bone.Ruta grav tincture,  diluted 1 in 10, externally .\nRuta grav 6c,  internally, every 3-4 house .\nFor painful muscle and tendons, from overexertion, with pain that is worse on initial motion and better on\ncontinued motion.\nRhus tox 6c,  every 3-4 hours .\nSunburnSunburn may lead to nothing more than a temporary reddening of the skin, or it may progress to blistering and\ndeeper damage.

The pimples are raised, red and usually pus-filled;blackheads are common. The pimples may or may not be painful.\nTreatmentExternal treatment of the skin should be as gentle as possible, avoiding harsh antiseptic soaps. Creams and\nointments containing antibiotics or the cortisone type of hormones should not be used, since general allergicreactions and permanent damage to the skin can easily occur.\nAvoid chocolate, cheese, nuts, soft drinks and junk food.

It is usually a decrease in the number of red\nblood cells, or a reduction in their hemoglobin content. Symptoms include pale face, fingernail beds and mucousmembranes, general fatigue and weakness, and shortness of breath. There are several possible causes, but the mostsignificant are excessive loss of blood, such as may be caused by very heavy menstrual bleeding, childbirth,gastrointestinal disease or an accident, and inadequate intake of iron. Vitamin B 12 is the missing factor in\npernicious anemia.\nTreatmentThe first action is to supplement the diet with extra iron, either through iron-rich foods such as red meat and\nparsley, or by iron supplements.

There is pain, swelling and,\nfrequently, changes in the joint structure. The condition usually begins in the small joints of the hands, especiallythe fingers, although other joints can be involved. With recurrent attacks, the joints can become swollen andimmobile. There can often be wasting of the surrounding muscle. General treatments of benefit include compresseson the affected parts and an alkaline diet.\nThe term arthritis covers more than a hundred different types of joint disease, the most common being rheumatoid\narthritis: and osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease where the joint tissues are attacked bythe body's own defenses. It is most often seen as a shifting attack on one or more joints at a time, frequentlysettling on the fingers, but sometimes involving many joints in increasing pain, swelling and immobility.\nOsteoarthritis is a degeneration of the joints that is most likely to strike those that receive the most use or stress\nover the years. As a result, the knees, big toes, spine, and end joints of the fingers are common sites of complaint.Symptoms vary from mild to severe depending on the amount of degeneration that has taken place. It is caused bythe disintegration of the cartilage that covers the ends of the bone, which leaves roughened surfaces and results instiffness and pain.\nTreatmentIn acute attacks, when the joint is swollen, painful and red, aggravated by motion.Ferrum phos 6x,  a tissue salt, every 3-4 hours .\nPain with sour-smelling sweat and a persistent creamy coating on the back of the tongue.Nat phos 6x,  a tissue salt, every 3-4 hours .\n \n< previous page page_51 next page >", "number": 74, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "appetite", "variable", "voracious", "indifferent", "child", "wants", "things", "rejects", "offered", "irritability", "grinds", "teeth", "night", "cina", "every", "hours", "appetite", "absent", "irritability", "especially", "excesses", "vomica", "every", "hours", "arthritisarthritis", "disorder", "affecting", "structure", "joints", "surrounding", "tissue", "pain", "swelling", "frequently", "changes", "joint", "structure", "condition", "usually", "begins", "small", "joints", "hands", "especiallythe", "fingers", "although", "joints", "involved", "recurrent", "attacks", "joints", "become", "swollen", "andimmobile", "often", "wasting", "surrounding", "muscle", "general", "treatments", "benefit", "include", "compresseson", "affected", "parts", "alkaline", "diet", "term", "arthritis", "covers", "hundred", "different", "types", "joint", "disease", "common", "rheumatoid", "arthritis", "osteoarthritis", "rheumatoid", "arthritis", "inflammatory", "disease", "joint", "tissues", "attacked", "bythe", "body", "defenses", "often", "seen", "shifting", "attack", "one", "joints", "time", "frequentlysettling", "fingers", "sometimes", "involving", "many", "joints", "increasing", "pain", "swelling", "immobility", "osteoarthritis", "degeneration", "joints", "likely", "strike", "receive", "use", "stress", "years", "result", "knees", "big", "toes", "spine", "end", "joints", "fingers", "common", "sites", "vary", "mild", "severe", "depending", "amount", "degeneration", "taken", "place", "caused", "bythe", "disintegration", "cartilage", "covers", "ends", "bone", "leaves", "roughened", "surfaces", "results", "instiffness", "pain", "treatmentin", "acute", "attacks", "joint", "swollen", "painful", "red", "aggravated", "phos", "tissue", "salt", "every", "hours", "pain", "sweat", "persistent", "creamy", "coating", "back", "phos", "tissue", "salt", "every", "hours", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_52 next page >\nPage 52\nPain and stiffness, often brought on by cold and damp and improved by heat.

Attacks vary greatly in frequency,duration and intensity, ranging from occasional periods of wheezing and breathing difficulty, to severe attacks thatalmost cause suffocation. Most of the symptoms arise from an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction taking place inthe bronchial walls.\nTreatmentA great improvement can often be seen by following a diet free of dairy products, wheat, oats, rye and barley.\nOther allergens, such as dusts and pollens, can also cause asthma, and can be treated by homeopathicdesensitisation. The following remedies are also of great use: they should be taken often during an attack, and 2-3times a day between attacks.

Itdiffers from influenza in that there is no bone pain, less prostration, and less sweat. In homeopathic treatment thecolor and effect of the discharges are important, as well as the influences that make the disorder better or worse.\nStages1 Mucous membrane inflammation and pain. Discharge is absent or minimal.2 Running of the nose, clear and more profuse, changing to white as the disorder progresses.

It can often be improved by drinking more water,\nintroducing oil, fiber and roughage into the diet, and reducing the intake of refined foods. The diet should includeplenty of fresh fruit, green vegetables, green salads and whole grains.\nConstipation has three main causes: inadequate lubrication of the bowel, irregular peristaltic action and irregular\noperation of the sphincters of the digestive tract. Inadequate lubrication causes a dry stool that is difficult to pass;irregular peristalsis results in incomplete movements; irregular sphincter operation causes constipation at irregularintervals. Often these three causes can be mixed together.\nStraining at stool increases the risk of hemorrhoids, which can easily become chronic in established constipation. It\nis wise to treat only occasional episodes of constipation with laxatives; recurrent or chronic constipation, especiallywith blood in the stools, should not be treated with laxatives and should be assessed professionally.\nTreatmentConstipation with heat in rectum, inflammation and fever.Ferrum phos 6x,  a tissue salt, every 3-4 hours .\nStool difficult to pass, with abdominal distension immediately after eating.Lycopodium 6c,  every 3-4 hours .\nObstinate retention of stool--irregular, hard, unsatisfactory.Nat mur 6x,  a tissue salt, every 3-4 hours .\nStool large, hard, and difficult to expel; may recede when partly expelled.Silicea 6x,  a tissue salt, every 3-4 hours .\nFrequent and ineffectual desire to defecate, producing only a little at a time which relieves for a while.

It is a common allergic reaction in children but it also occurs in adults,usually in more severe form. Childhood eczema often begins in infancy, the rash appearing on the face, neck andfolds of elbows and knees, and is often due to an allergy to cow's milk or formula. It may disappear by itself whenthe offending food is removed from the diet, or it may become more extensive and in some instances cover theentire surface of the body.\nSeborrheic eczema seems to be inherited, and not linked to an allergy. It shows as a flaking itchiness in the smile\nlines between the nose and mouth, in the beard area, around the hairline, in the scalp, groin and armpits, and on thechest. Severe eczema can be complicated by skin infections.\nThe orthodox treatment of eczema commonly involves the use of steroid ointments to relieve the inflammation,\nand sometimes antihistamines and antibiotics to control the itching and infection. The homeopathic treatment ofeczema involves constitutional treatment; however, the following remedies can be used for general treatment.Steroid ointments should be avoided except in extreme cases.\n \n< previous page page_79 next page >", "number": 110, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "earache", "swelling", "glands", "tongue", "coated", "white", "kali", "mur", "tissue", "salt", "every", "hours", "earache", "yellow", "catarrh", "ear", "yellow", "sulph", "tissue", "salt", "every", "hours", "shooting", "pains", "every", "minutes", "pain", "stinging", "burning", "better", "cold", "every", "minutes", "patient", "tearful", "seeks", "comfort", "irritable", "pain", "centres", "behind", "ear", "sensitive", "touch", "made", "better", "hot", "applications", "capsicum", "every", "minutes", "deafness", "noises", "ear", "nervous", "weakness", "phos", "tissue", "salt", "every", "hours", "eczemaeczema", "skin", "rash", "characterised", "itching", "swelling", "thickening", "scaling", "blistering", "dry", "eczema", "oozing", "weeping", "discharging", "wet", "eczema", "common", "allergic", "reaction", "children", "also", "occurs", "adults", "usually", "severe", "form", "childhood", "eczema", "often", "begins", "infancy", "rash", "appearing", "face", "neck", "andfolds", "elbows", "knees", "often", "due", "allergy", "cow", "milk", "formula", "may", "disappear", "whenthe", "offending", "food", "removed", "diet", "may", "become", "extensive", "instances", "cover", "theentire", "surface", "body", "seborrheic", "eczema", "seems", "inherited", "linked", "allergy", "shows", "flaking", "itchiness", "smile", "lines", "nose", "mouth", "beard", "area", "around", "hairline", "scalp", "groin", "armpits", "thechest", "severe", "eczema", "complicated", "skin", "infections", "orthodox", "treatment", "eczema", "commonly", "involves", "use", "steroid", "ointments", "relieve", "inflammation", "sometimes", "antihistamines", "antibiotics", "control", "itching", "infection", "homeopathic", "treatment", "ofeczema", "involves", "constitutional", "treatment", "however", "following", "remedies", "used", "general", "ointments", "avoided", "except", "extreme", "cases", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_80 next page >\nPage 80\nTreatment\nAs a general application to help itching and drying in dry eczema.Chickweed  ointment or  Urtica  tincture, morning and evening.\nIn wet eczema.Chickweed  ointment or  Calendula  tincture, morning and evening.\nDry eczema in hot, sweaty types with rough, itching skin, made worse from washing and the heat of the bed.Sulphur 6c,  morning and evening for several weeks.

There may be fast, shallow breathing, cramps and muscle twitches, and a weak but rapid pulse. Thetemperature may be normal or below normal. Heat exhaustion shows symptoms similar to sunstroke; both haveheadache, dizziness and weakness, but in heat exhaustion there is sweating with a normal or below normaltemperature, while in sunstroke there is a high temperature and absence of sweating.

It is also useful when given as soon as the firstsymptoms appear, and the earlier it is given the more effective it is. Give one dose daily for one week.

For the most part, the illnesses are mild\nand rarely life-threatening, while drug treatment is often inappropriate due to problems of toxicity.\nIt is in this area that homeopathic medicine has much to offer, but remember that babies can become seriously ill\nmuch more quickly than adults and children. If well-indicated remedies fail to give improvement, professionaladvice should always be sought.\nThe problems of infants usually revolve around feeding disorders and skin rashes. Usually the problem is that the\nbaby cannot tolerate milk, vomits it, has wind or colic, or has diarrhea. Skin disorders include cradle cap, nappyrash and thrush. There also may be irritability, sleeplessness, and crying without apparent cause.\nFor more general disorders that are as applicable to adults as infants, consult Chapter 3, \"Common Problems.\"\n \n< previous page page_133 next page >", "number": 174, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "treatment", "infants", "problems", "infants", "children", "represent", "special", "area", "medicine", "part", "illnesses", "mild", "rarely", "drug", "treatment", "often", "inappropriate", "due", "problems", "toxicity", "area", "homeopathic", "medicine", "much", "offer", "remember", "babies", "become", "seriously", "ill", "much", "quickly", "adults", "children", "remedies", "fail", "give", "improvement", "professionaladvice", "always", "sought", "problems", "infants", "usually", "revolve", "around", "feeding", "disorders", "skin", "rashes", "usually", "problem", "baby", "tolerate", "milk", "vomits", "wind", "colic", "diarrhea", "skin", "disorders", "include", "cradle", "cap", "nappyrash", "thrush", "also", "may", "irritability", "sleeplessness", "crying", "without", "apparent", "cause", "general", "disorders", "applicable", "adults", "infants", "consult", "chapter", "common", "problems", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_134 next page >\nPage 134\nColic\nIntestinal colic is an attack of abdominal pain caused by contractions of the intestines, most common during the\nfirst three months of life. Pulling up of the arms and legs, restlessness, crying loudly and turning red in the face arecommon symptoms, eased by belching and passing gas. In a breast-fed baby, colic can be caused by maternaltension and anxiety, a reaction to dairy products, wheat, beans, cabbage or citrus fruits in the maternal diet, or thebaby being held at an extreme angle while feeding, causing air swallowing. In a bottle-fed baby, colic may also bedue to air swallowing because the hole in the nipple is too small.\nTreatmentColic with drawing up of the legs, and relieved by heat and bending double, not relieved by belching.

It is contagious from the first appearance of symptoms until the rash disappears, usually three orfour days. It is similar to measles but is more trivial. One attack usually confers immunity for life. The lesions arepaler, completely flat, and do not usually run together. The first symptoms are a slight cold, some fever and a sorethroat. The lymph nodes behind the ears and at the back of the neck may swell. The rash is orange-red, appearsfirst on the face and scalp, and spreads to the body and arms the same day. The rash fades after two or three days.Complications are rare in children, but dangerous in pregnant women, as they can cause heart defect, cataract,mental retardation and deafness in the fetus.\nTreatmentTo treat the illness in the fever stage, to limit the course of the disease, see Fever.

It has an incubation period of 7-14\ndays, average about 11. It is contagious for four days before the appearance of the rash, and until it fades. In theearly stages it has the symptoms of influenza: there is inflammation and fever accompanied by sneezing,drowsiness, lassitude, irritability, aching in the back and limbs, shivering and thirst. There is a peculiar, hoarse, drycough.\nThe measles eruption appears generally on the fourth day, with small red spots like fleabites joining together into\nirregular circles as horseshoes. The spots are elevated, and may take 1-2 days to mature; they are usually first seenat the back of the ears and frontal hairline. At this stage the fever and respiratory symptoms will be at their height.\nAt 7-8 days from the onset, the illness subsides and the eruption fades, replaced by small bran-like scales, lasting\nabout a further week. During this period, it is important that there is no exposure to chill or cold, and that exposureto bright light is minimised.\n \n< previous page page_156 next page >", "number": 198, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "crying", "whining", "without", "apparent", "cause", "hard", "please", "wants", "refused", "restless", "thirsty", "wants", "carried", "better", "chamomilla", "every", "hours", "irritability", "anger", "worse", "mornings", "better", "warmth", "may", "constipation", "vomica", "every", "hours", "child", "anxious", "sleep", "restless", "dreams", "eyes", "irritable", "every", "hours", "irritability", "anger", "spiteful", "invite", "comfort", "particularly", "teething", "history", "boils", "styes", "staphysagria", "every", "hours", "wants", "things", "rejects", "offered", "irritability", "appetite", "variable", "always", "every", "hours", "result", "sulph", "every", "hours", "rich", "vomica", "every", "hours", "measlesmeasles", "otherwise", "known", "morbillis", "highly", "infectious", "viral", "disease", "incubation", "period", "days", "average", "contagious", "four", "days", "appearance", "rash", "fades", "theearly", "stages", "symptoms", "influenza", "inflammation", "fever", "accompanied", "sneezing", "drowsiness", "lassitude", "irritability", "aching", "back", "limbs", "shivering", "thirst", "peculiar", "hoarse", "drycough", "measles", "eruption", "appears", "generally", "fourth", "day", "small", "red", "spots", "like", "fleabites", "joining", "together", "irregular", "circles", "horseshoes", "spots", "elevated", "may", "take", "days", "mature", "usually", "first", "seenat", "back", "ears", "frontal", "hairline", "stage", "fever", "respiratory", "symptoms", "height", "days", "onset", "illness", "subsides", "eruption", "fades", "replaced", "small", "scales", "lasting", "week", "period", "important", "exposure", "chill", "cold", "exposureto", "bright", "light", "minimised", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_157 next page >\nPage 157\nMost cases are uncomplicated, the most common complication being convulsion in young children when the rash is\nappearing.

It can last for anything from 2-10 weeks. It starts like a cold, with a mild fever and runny nose, but theharsh, dry coughs become grouped together progressively into spasms of coughing. A whoop develops at the endof a coughing spasm, as the child fights to regain breath. Coughing may be violent enough to cause blue face,nosebleeds and vomiting. Complications include pneumonia and brain damage due to burst blood vessels in thebrain. Homeopathic treatment of whooping cough is effective, and especially so if treated early. If the coughcontinues in spite of well-indicated remedies, allopathic advice should be sought, especially in infants.\nTreatmentThe remedies should be given sparingly, to reduce the chance of aggravation.

The truth is that a person of 40 now will live only two orthree years longer than a person of 40 did in 1900. The apparently greater rise in life expectancy has been achievedby reductions in the infant mortality rate, that is, the chances of survival are now better for babies and youngchildren. This improvement has been attributed to two main factors: the increased standards of hygiene andsanitation now existing in our communities, and vaccination.\n \n< previous page page_163 next page >", "number": 206, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "established", "stage", "spasmodic", "cough", "constant", "tickle", "throat", "suffocative", "spells", "blueness", "face", "may", "go", "quite", "stiff", "bleed", "nose", "wheezing", "rattling", "chest", "gagging", "vomiting", "mucus", "notimproved", "ipecac", "every", "hours", "dry", "frequent", "noisy", "spasmodic", "cough", "scarcely", "breathe", "coughs", "may", "retch", "gag", "cough", "comes", "bouts", "throat", "tickled", "cough", "painful", "worse", "midnight", "around", "betterby", "holding", "chest", "drosera", "every", "hours", "violent", "explosive", "spasmodic", "cough", "stopped", "worse", "breathing", "cold", "air", "followed", "profuse", "vomiting", "mucus", "corallium", "rubrum", "every", "hours", "bouts", "coughing", "bringing", "sticky", "mucus", "sometimes", "vomiting", "worse", "midnight", "morning", "waking", "better", "drinking", "cold", "water", "coccus", "cacti", "every", "hours", "spasmodic", "dry", "cough", "suffocative", "bouts", "blueness", "face", "may", "spasms", "throat", "fits", "sobbing", "fists", "may", "tightly", "closed", "thumbs", "tucked", "symptoms", "improved", "drinking", "cold", "water", "cuprum", "met", "every", "hours", "cough", "mainly", "dry", "little", "mucus", "expelled", "suffocating", "blocks", "every", "hours", "vaccinationone", "great", "strides", "allopathic", "medicine", "considerable", "increase", "life", "expectancy", "enjoyed", "population", "figure", "matter", "statistics", "truth", "person", "live", "two", "orthree", "years", "longer", "person", "apparently", "greater", "rise", "life", "expectancy", "achievedby", "reductions", "infant", "mortality", "rate", "chances", "survival", "better", "babies", "youngchildren", "improvement", "attributed", "two", "main", "factors", "increased", "standards", "hygiene", "andsanitation", "existing", "communities", "vaccination", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_164 next page >\nPage 164\nThere is no question that increased hygiene has contributed to the decreased infantile mortality rate, but this is as\nmuch due to increases in general living standards, such as better sewerage and septic tank use, as it is to advancesin medicine.\nOne of the strongest arguments in favor of vaccination is that the chance of complications in infectious diseases is\nreduced. While vaccination has been of great benefit in underdevelopted countries in controlling infections likepolio, diphtheria and measles, and reducing the rate of complication, a deeper problem exists in the bulk of thesecountries: malnutrition. It is this malnutrition that lowers immune resistance in the first place and sets the stage forthe life-threatening complications of infectious diseases common in these countries, especially in the children.\nIn developed countries the situation is very different, as standards of nutrition and hygiene are much higher. Even\nso, vaccination is recommended by government. This solution is not a total one, however, as vaccination alwayshas a failure rate (that is, it may not ensure immunity from the disease), which may be 25 per cent or higher. Inaddition, the incidence of bad reactions to vaccinations is now being examined for the first time, and there isevidence that adverse reactions to vaccinations have been under-reported. So in the end, the advantages vaccinationmay offer in reducing complications in a disease like measles may be offset by the chance of failure in thevaccination and the possibility of a bad reaction to the vaccine.\nThe treatment of these infectious disorders by homeopathic medicine is regarded by the profession as largely\nsuccessful, and the incidence of complications is rare in clinical experience. Furthermore, homeopaths believe thatit is important for children to contract these diseases naturally, as it strengthens their immune system and reducesthe risk of more serious diseases later in life.\nCountering Ill Effects Of Vaccination\nIf you do plan to vaccinate your child, you may also consider using the remedies below to counter any ill-effects\nand assist in the removal of residual toxins.\n \n< previous page page_164 next page >", "number": 207, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "question", "increased", "hygiene", "contributed", "decreased", "infantile", "mortality", "rate", "much", "due", "increases", "general", "living", "standards", "better", "sewerage", "septic", "tank", "use", "advancesin", "medicine", "one", "strongest", "arguments", "favor", "vaccination", "chance", "complications", "infectious", "diseases", "reduced", "vaccination", "great", "benefit", "underdevelopted", "countries", "controlling", "infections", "likepolio", "diphtheria", "measles", "reducing", "rate", "complication", "deeper", "problem", "exists", "bulk", "thesecountries", "malnutrition", "malnutrition", "lowers", "immune", "resistance", "first", "place", "sets", "stage", "forthe", "complications", "infectious", "diseases", "common", "countries", "especially", "children", "developed", "countries", "situation", "different", "standards", "nutrition", "hygiene", "much", "higher", "even", "vaccination", "recommended", "government", "solution", "total", "one", "however", "vaccination", "alwayshas", "failure", "rate", "may", "ensure", "immunity", "disease", "may", "per", "cent", "higher", "inaddition", "incidence", "bad", "reactions", "vaccinations", "examined", "first", "time", "isevidence", "adverse", "reactions", "vaccinations", "end", "advantages", "vaccinationmay", "offer", "reducing", "complications", "disease", "like", "measles", "may", "offset", "chance", "failure", "thevaccination", "possibility", "bad", "reaction", "vaccine", "treatment", "infectious", "disorders", "homeopathic", "medicine", "regarded", "profession", "largely", "successful", "incidence", "complications", "rare", "clinical", "experience", "furthermore", "homeopaths", "believe", "thatit", "important", "children", "contract", "diseases", "naturally", "strengthens", "immune", "system", "reducesthe", "risk", "serious", "diseases", "later", "life", "countering", "ill", "effects", "vaccination", "plan", "vaccinate", "child", "may", "also", "consider", "using", "remedies", "counter", "assist", "removal", "residual", "toxins", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_165 next page >\nPage 165\nTo counter general ill effects.\nVitamin C  (calcium ascorbate) dose according to age, for 1 week before and after vaccination.

Reading and using this book will help educate you inthese areas, as will a regular contact with a local homeopathic practitioner.\nThe remedies below may be used as a general protection for epidemic diseases whenever they are reported\ncurrently in the community. These remedies are not vaccines, and will not prevent the child from getting theillness, as homeopaths believe that it is important for the child to contract the disease naturally and so gain a propernatural immunity. However, the clinical experience of the profession shows that children using these remediescontract the illness in a much milder form, the course of the disease is shortened and the incidence ofcomplications reduced. As a result, the remedies are not true vaccines and are more correctly called prophylactics.\nIt is important to realize, however, that these remedies have no protective action after the illness has been acquired.\nOnce a child shows a specific illness, such as measles, the remedies in that section should be checked to treat theillness more specifically.\nThe following remedies are known as nosodes, and are available from homeopathic practitioners.

In a typical attack there is a severe pain in a joint, usually the big toe. The joint swells and becomes hot,and any jarring causes intense pain. In chronic gout the joint becomes permanently enlarged, and remains tenderand sensitive at all times. The diet must be changed to eliminate foods rich in purines, which include liver,sardines, oysters and anchovies.

Chief amongst these is genetic inheritance, as baldnesstends to run in families. Stress also accelerates hair loss, due to constriction of the blood vessels in the scalp whichfeed the hair follicles; relaxation and daily scalp massage can do much here to slow down the hair loss.Homeopathic treatment is generally constitutional, but the following remedies taken for several weeks and thenrepeated periodically have had some clinical effect in slowing hair loss.

Prepared fromnon-poisonous wild flowers, the purpose of the Bach Flower Remedies is to achieve a balance between the mind,body and spirit, gently correcting the emotional upsets that give rise to physical symptoms or delay recovery froman illness.\nEdward Bach was a physician well ahead of his time. In his short career he moved from orthodox medicine into\ndeveloping a natural form of medicine to treat emotional and spiritual health, very much in tune with the trends innatural medicine in the 1990s. Bach wrote:\nDisease of the body itself is nothing but the result of the disharmony between soul and mind. It is only asymptom of the cause, and it is our fears, our cares, our anxieties and such like that open the path to theinvasion of illness. Remove the disharmony, the fear, the terror or the indecision, and we regain harmonybetween soul and mind, and the body is once more perfect in all its parts.\nFrom an early age, Bach had been aware that people's personality and attitudes have a bearing on their state ofhealth.

In 1912 he qualified at University College\nHospital, London, where he became Casualty Medical Officer and later Casualty House Surgeon at the NationalTemperance Hospital. He also developed a very busy practice close to Harley Street in London.\nFrom 1919 to 1922 Dr Bach worked as a pathologist and bacteriologist at the London Homoeopathic Hospital.\nThere, he learned that Samuel Hahnemann, the founder of homeopathy, had recognised the importance ofpersonality in disease 150 years before. Combining these principles with his knowledge of orthodox medicine,Bach developed seven oral vaccines based on intestinal bacteria which purified the intestinal tract. Bach then madea most important and significant discovery: all the patients suffering from the same emotional difficulties neededthe same vaccine, irrespective of the type of disease. From then onwards he prescribed these vaccines according tohis patients' temperamental difficulties only. The results were excellent, and these seven vaccines are still used byhomeopaths today with great success.\nAlthough the medical profession adopted his vaccines, Bach disliked the fact that they were based on bacteria, and\nwas anxious to replace these with gentler methods, possibly based on plants. He was increasingly dissatisfied withthe limitations of orthodox medicine, especially its focus on curing symptoms. Bach closed his laboratory and hislucrative practice and went to Wales to seek further knowledge in nature. Walking through a dew-laden field earlyone morning, it struck him that each dewdrop, heated by the sun, would be imbued with the healing properties ofthe plant it lay on. This was the basis of the development of the flower essences.\nAs he continued his work, his intuition became so sensitive that, by holding a flower or tasting a petal, he could\nimmediately sense what its healing effects would be. He would suffer the states of mind and body for which theflower was neededa painful and exhausting method of research, but one that gave him a great understanding of hispatients. Bach then moved to Cromer, on the Norfolk coast, finding and preparing further flower essences andsuccessfully treating patients with them.\n \n< previous page page_206 next page >", "number": 258, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "hospital", "wards", "bach", "took", "interest", "patients", "people", "rather", "cases", "early", "came", "conclusion", "illness", "personality", "important", "symptoms", "taken", "account", "medical", "treatment", "bach", "early", "medical", "career", "conventional", "successful", "qualified", "university", "college", "hospital", "london", "became", "casualty", "medical", "officer", "later", "casualty", "house", "surgeon", "nationaltemperance", "hospital", "also", "developed", "busy", "practice", "close", "harley", "street", "london", "dr", "bach", "worked", "pathologist", "bacteriologist", "london", "homoeopathic", "hospital", "learned", "samuel", "hahnemann", "founder", "homeopathy", "recognised", "importance", "ofpersonality", "disease", "years", "combining", "principles", "knowledge", "orthodox", "medicine", "bach", "developed", "seven", "oral", "vaccines", "based", "intestinal", "bacteria", "purified", "intestinal", "tract", "bach", "madea", "important", "significant", "discovery", "patients", "suffering", "emotional", "difficulties", "neededthe", "vaccine", "irrespective", "type", "disease", "onwards", "prescribed", "vaccines", "according", "tohis", "patients", "temperamental", "difficulties", "results", "excellent", "seven", "vaccines", "still", "used", "byhomeopaths", "today", "great", "success", "although", "medical", "profession", "adopted", "vaccines", "bach", "disliked", "fact", "based", "bacteria", "anxious", "replace", "gentler", "methods", "possibly", "based", "plants", "increasingly", "dissatisfied", "withthe", "limitations", "orthodox", "medicine", "especially", "focus", "curing", "symptoms", "bach", "closed", "laboratory", "hislucrative", "practice", "went", "wales", "seek", "knowledge", "nature", "walking", "field", "earlyone", "morning", "struck", "dewdrop", "heated", "sun", "would", "imbued", "healing", "properties", "ofthe", "plant", "lay", "basis", "development", "flower", "essences", "continued", "work", "intuition", "became", "sensitive", "holding", "flower", "tasting", "petal", "could", "immediately", "sense", "healing", "effects", "would", "would", "suffer", "states", "mind", "body", "theflower", "neededa", "painful", "exhausting", "method", "research", "one", "gave", "great", "understanding", "hispatients", "bach", "moved", "cromer", "norfolk", "coast", "finding", "preparing", "flower", "essences", "andsuccessfully", "treating", "patients", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_207 next page >\nPage 207\nBach intended the use of the remedies to be straightforward and simple enough for all to understand.

An immediate dose of RescueRemedy after an emergency can contribute greatly to counteracting its effects and helping the natural process totake its course.\nPrescribing Bach Remedies\nThe purpose of the Bach Remedies is to support the fight against illness by relieving depression, anxiety, trauma\nand other emotional factors that impede healing. They can also be used preventatively at times of high anxiety andstress, and are particularly helpful for those generally unwell and tired, but without any specific medical diagnosis.They take effect through treating the individual, not disease or symptoms of disease. They work specifically on theemotional and spiritual condition of the person concerned. The remedies are intended primarily as a means of self-help, and so self-diagnosis is not difficult.\nThe descriptions of the states for which the remedies are recommended are not always flattering, and it may be\nhard to recognize personal traits in them. Bear in mind these are descriptions of extreme states only.

The fact that they have been recognized is the first step to inner healing. The corresponding\npositive states will help identify and clarify the correct remedy. As Bach said, \"There are seven beautiful stages inthe healing of disease, Peace, Hope, Joy, Faith, Certainty, Wisdom, and Love.\"\nThe type remedyIn selecting the correct remedy for each person, it is important to choose according to the personality as a whole,\nso the remedy can be based on a complete picture. The descriptions, both positive and negative, will give importantclues in helping determine the particular type remedy for each person. This remedy should be used in allprescriptions.\nThe treatment period of Bach Flower Remedies must be decided on an individual basis, as each person is different\nand every situation is unique. Generally, however, moods and emotions that have developed suddenly or recentlywill not take long to correct. Perhaps only a few doses will be required. But for problems that have become deep-rooted and firmly established, perhaps over a period of months or even years, healing will be a much more gradualprocess and will naturally take longer.\nIt does help the healing process if it is approached with positive thought, and although this may be difficult in the\nbeginning, the remedies do help the taker to feel more optimistic and thus give hope and lift their spirits. Thepositive aspect which is strived forthe confidence, courageis already within us and is re-awakened with BachFlower Remedies. The remedies do not change the person into someone different, just into themselves again.\nExtra remedies in a prescriptionWhen dealing with a particular life problem, emotional states other than those in the -type remedy will appear. So\nat any time the person may have a variety of emotional states operating. These can be prescribed for concurrently,and up to three extra remedies can be included with the type remedy in a particular prescription. When prescribing,it always helps to look for the root cause of the particular problem.\nHow much to takeBach Remedies are taken orally, either 2 drops directly on the tongue or 4 drops in a small amount of water which\nis sipped slowly.

In acute cases, such as after an accident or other trauma, the remedies may be\ntaken as often as every 10 minutes.\nWhen to take Bach RemediesPeople are most susceptible to the healing influence of Bach Flowers at bedtime and on risingat these times we are\nusually most relaxed, and so most receptive. During sleep we also process much of the day's stress, and receiveinsights from the unconscious. The two remaining doses should be taken as evenly apart across the day as possible,for instance, just before lunch and just before the evening meal. Other times ideal for taking the Bach Remediesare: while having a bath (they may also be put in the bathwater); after meditation and relaxation practices; duringtherapy; or any other relaxed, secure and open time.\nBabies and childrenBabies and children can be given Bach Remedies with complete safety and very good results. Children and babies\nsuffer from many emotions and go through times of stress and unhappiness; dealing with these in childhood canhelp them grow up happily and healthily. The remedies should be chosen in exactly the same way as for adults,whether the child is suffering from a physical illness or is fretful, unhappy or difficult for no obvious reason. Thechild's personality and current characteristics are the guide to the reduired remedy or combination of remedies.\nAnimalsAs with children, animals respond well to Bach Remedies. To prescribe, once again, the temperament of the animal\nconcerned needs to be considered, together with its mood and nature generally. Drops of the remedy can be givenon food or in drinking water: 4 drops for birds and small animals, 10 drops for larger animals.\nPlantsPlants can benefit from the gentle healing properties of the Bach Flowers at watering time, however eccentric it\nmay appear. As plants do not express their feelings or answer questions, their outlook is displayed through theirappearance and it is on this expression of need that the remedy is chosen.\n \n< previous page page_216 next page >", "number": 268, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "frequency", "dose", "times", "daily", "acute", "cases", "accident", "trauma", "remedies", "may", "taken", "often", "every", "minutes", "take", "bach", "remediespeople", "susceptible", "healing", "influence", "bach", "flowers", "bedtime", "risingat", "times", "usually", "relaxed", "receptive", "sleep", "also", "process", "much", "day", "stress", "receiveinsights", "unconscious", "two", "remaining", "doses", "taken", "evenly", "apart", "across", "day", "possible", "instance", "lunch", "evening", "meal", "times", "ideal", "taking", "bach", "remediesare", "bath", "may", "also", "put", "bathwater", "meditation", "relaxation", "practices", "duringtherapy", "relaxed", "secure", "open", "time", "babies", "childrenbabies", "children", "given", "bach", "remedies", "complete", "safety", "good", "results", "children", "babies", "suffer", "many", "emotions", "go", "times", "stress", "unhappiness", "dealing", "childhood", "canhelp", "grow", "happily", "healthily", "remedies", "chosen", "exactly", "way", "adults", "whether", "child", "suffering", "physical", "illness", "fretful", "unhappy", "difficult", "obvious", "reason", "thechild", "personality", "current", "characteristics", "guide", "reduired", "remedy", "combination", "remedies", "animalsas", "children", "animals", "respond", "well", "bach", "remedies", "prescribe", "temperament", "animal", "concerned", "needs", "considered", "together", "mood", "nature", "generally", "drops", "remedy", "givenon", "food", "drinking", "water", "drops", "birds", "small", "animals", "drops", "larger", "animals", "plantsplants", "benefit", "gentle", "healing", "properties", "bach", "flowers", "watering", "time", "however", "eccentric", "may", "appear", "plants", "express", "feelings", "answer", "questions", "outlook", "displayed", "theirappearance", "expression", "need", "remedy", "chosen", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_217 next page >\nPage 217\nSafety\nThe Flower Remedies are completely safe, have no unwanted side-effects and are non-addictive. They are gentle in\naction and can be safely taken by people of all ages, from newborn babies to the aged. If a remedy is picked that isinappropriate, there is no threat of harm; rather, the remedy will simply have no effect.\nRescue RemedyThe most famous of all Bach Flower Remedies is the appropriately named Rescue Remedy. As described above,\nRescue Remedy is a composite of five Bach remedies. It is a calming panacea that settles nerves, dispels negativethoughts, relieves apprehension and restores balance and confidence. It is ideal for any emergency situation as wellas ongoing stressful situations. For example, Rescue Remedy is excellent for shocks, accidents, interviews, exams,speeches, child tantrums, bereavement, dentist or hospital visits, panic situations and mental tensionall commonstressors that affect everyone in our society. Rescue Remedy is also ideal for the treatment of hurt animals as oftenshock and terror is a major cause of their trouble. When transplanting plants, giving Rescue Remedy afterwardsreduces the effects of the trauma and helps them to take root again.\nHealing the Mind\nAt the end of 1936, Edward Bach died in his sleep, content that his mission was complete. He provided the world\nwith a legacy of remedies to help us if we lose our way, or find ourselves turning back, or if we are uncertain andfeel afraid about taking the next step. They help and guide us, but true progressour real healingcomes from within.Dr Bach's most famous quote probably sums it all up best: \"There is no true healing unless there is a change inoutlook, peace of mind and inner happiness.\"\n \n< previous page page_217 next page >", "number": 269, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "safety", "flower", "remedies", "completely", "safe", "unwanted", "gentle", "action", "safely", "taken", "people", "ages", "newborn", "babies", "aged", "remedy", "picked", "isinappropriate", "threat", "harm", "rather", "remedy", "simply", "effect", "rescue", "remedythe", "famous", "bach", "flower", "remedies", "appropriately", "named", "rescue", "remedy", "described", "rescue", "remedy", "composite", "five", "bach", "remedies", "calming", "panacea", "settles", "nerves", "dispels", "negativethoughts", "relieves", "apprehension", "restores", "balance", "confidence", "ideal", "emergency", "situation", "wellas", "ongoing", "stressful", "situations", "example", "rescue", "remedy", "excellent", "shocks", "accidents", "interviews", "exams", "speeches", "child", "tantrums", "bereavement", "dentist", "hospital", "visits", "panic", "situations", "mental", "tensionall", "commonstressors", "affect", "everyone", "society", "rescue", "remedy", "also", "ideal", "treatment", "hurt", "animals", "oftenshock", "terror", "major", "cause", "trouble", "transplanting", "plants", "giving", "rescue", "remedy", "afterwardsreduces", "effects", "trauma", "helps", "take", "root", "healing", "mind", "end", "edward", "bach", "died", "sleep", "content", "mission", "complete", "provided", "world", "legacy", "remedies", "help", "us", "lose", "way", "find", "turning", "back", "uncertain", "andfeel", "afraid", "taking", "next", "step", "help", "guide", "us", "true", "progressour", "real", "healingcomes", "bach", "famous", "quote", "probably", "sums", "best", "true", "healing", "unless", "change", "inoutlook", "peace", "mind", "inner", "happiness", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_219 next page >\nPage 219\nPART THREE\nA MATERIA MEDICA OF COMMON REMEDIES\n \n< previous page page_219 next page >", "number": 270, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "part", "three", "materia", "medica", "common", "remedies", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_221 next page >\nPage 221\n11\nMateria Medica of the Tissue Salts\nA materia medica is the term used by homeopaths for a collection and description of remedies and how they are\nused. The remedies listed in the next two chapters have been chosen for several reasons: they are well suited to thesorts of diseases found in the average home, they are safe and easy to use, and they have clear-cut symptoms. Mostof the remedies mentioned in the text are included here. The materia medica is divided into two. The first chapter isa materia medica of the tissue salts, which can easily be obtained from most health-food stores. The followingchapter lists more mainstream homeopathic remedies.\nHomeopathic medicines, including tissue salts, treat the patient as an individual and the body as a whole. Each\nremedy in this materia medica is summarized, showing the main pattern of symptoms it is used to treat. Oftenmental symptoms are included, and also the influences that make the symptoms worse or better, otherwise knownas the modalities. All these combined make up what homeopaths call the symptom picture of the remedy.\nRemembering this pattern of symptoms for the remedy is the key to prescribing. The remedy that has the symptom\npicture most closely matching the symptoms of the patient is known in homeopathy as the similimum, the mostsimilar remedy, and is the one to prescribe.\n \n< previous page page_221 next page >", "number": 271, "clean_text": ["previous", "page", "next", "page", "page", "materia", "medica", "tissue", "salts", "materia", "medica", "term", "used", "homeopaths", "collection", "description", "remedies", "used", "remedies", "listed", "next", "two", "chapters", "chosen", "several", "reasons", "well", "suited", "thesorts", "diseases", "found", "average", "home", "safe", "easy", "use", "symptoms", "mostof", "remedies", "mentioned", "text", "included", "materia", "medica", "divided", "two", "first", "chapter", "isa", "materia", "medica", "tissue", "salts", "easily", "obtained", "stores", "followingchapter", "lists", "mainstream", "homeopathic", "remedies", "homeopathic", "medicines", "including", "tissue", "salts", "treat", "patient", "individual", "body", "whole", "remedy", "materia", "medica", "summarized", "showing", "main", "pattern", "symptoms", "used", "treat", "oftenmental", "symptoms", "included", "also", "influences", "make", "symptoms", "worse", "better", "otherwise", "knownas", "modalities", "combined", "make", "homeopaths", "call", "symptom", "picture", "remedy", "remembering", "pattern", "symptoms", "remedy", "key", "prescribing", "remedy", "symptom", "picture", "closely", "matching", "symptoms", "patient", "known", "homeopathy", "similimum", "mostsimilar", "remedy", "one", "prescribe", "previous", "page", "next", "page"]}, {"content": "< previous page page_222 next page >\nPage 222\nIn choosing a remedy, there are three main areas for attention:\nthe physical symptoms;the mental and emotional symptoms;the influences that make the symptoms better or worse.On the other hand, not every symptom covered in the remedy picture needs to be seen in the patient. As a general\nrule, three good symptoms, characteristic of the remedy and strong in the patient, are enough to indicate theremedy.\nChoosing a remedy on just a few physical symptoms alone is the system most prone to error, and often results in\nthe remedy failing in its action. For the best result, the mental and emotional symptoms, such as irritability ortearfulness, should be included as part of the symptom picture, and the choice of remedy reviewed. If, as well, youcan include some of the modalities, the influences which make the symptoms better or worse, then you are veryclose to the similimum, or most similar remedy.\nClearly, to choose a remedy well, the prescriber must be attentive to many small details of the patient's condition\nwhich are of no interest to allopathic medicine, with its emphasis on medical tests. In this way homeopathicmedicine is perhaps a superior medicine because it is more subtle, treating the person at a deeper level; but it is alsomore demanding of the prescriber. Small details of the patient's behaviorsuch as the color of the face, the mode ofdress, the way of moving, sitting and lyingcan all be symptoms of pure gold to the homeopath.\nSince there are many remedies and many symptoms, the ability to know and match symptom pictures is vital, and\nis probably the greatest challenge of homeopathy. For the beginner, keywords are useful, to draw the strands of aremedy together. These are given at the end of the remedy's description and help as quick summaries of symptompictures. They are especially useful when a remedy must be chosen quickly.\nA more detailed symptom picture of a remedy is also given in the materia medica, and is suited to more\nexperienced prescribers, who are comfortable with remembering symptom pictures.\nThe ability to remember whole symptom pictures is a highly developed skill.
